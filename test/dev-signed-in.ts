// The signed-in local site, for looking at the threads page in a real browser before a deploy:
// `npm run dev:signed-in` serves the home page at http://localhost:8790/ and the threads at http://hey.localhost:8790/
// (site/hosts.js; a browser sends every *.localhost to this machine) from the Worker's own bundle in workerd
// (test/harness.ts), each request to the host it was sent to, with a local D1 and R2 holding a few made-up threads,
// and plays Cloudflare Access by signing every call under /threads/api/ as the owner, the way the edge hands a signed-in request over. `--signed-out` signs nothing, so the
// page shows what a visitor sees; `--member <address>` signs every call as a person signed in by that address, so
// the page shows what an invited person sees. The seed always shares one thread ("Who owns what") with a made-up
// person, Meera, at that address or meera@example.com, who has the last word on it, beside an "Only me" comment of
// the owner's: the owner's Today shows it waiting on him, and the invited person never sees the note. One thread of
// his own is public ("Shipping Planton 0.1.0, in public"), shared with the same person, with a comment of his
// written for anyone and two visitors' notes, one of whose words hold Markdown and a link that must show as typed;
// signed out, its address shows the public view. The pricing page thread is public as well, and not shared, so the
// invited person reads it in the public view too. A third public thread's page asks questions ("A cold read"), with
// two visitors' answers from two browsers' keys, both named Sam, so signed out the page takes answers with a name,
// shows a visitor other people's answers once they gave their own, and opens in full screen at `?full`. All three
// public threads are posted on the home page, a page, a text with notes and a page with answers, under his Now line,
// beside what arrives from outside as the hourly run keeps it: two made-up episodes (one with its picture in the local
// bucket, test/fixtures/thumb.jpg, one without) and a made-up release of each product, so http://localhost:8790/
// shows every shape of item and /feed.xml its feed. Everyone in the seed is a person: Asha wrote
// from the site and was then invited to the meetup thread, Dev K. told him something in person, Meera is invited
// (with his own notes on her), Tomás wrote on the public thread with an address (Priya gave none, so she is no
// person), and Rex's only note was junk he dropped, so Rex sits under the people only in dropped threads. Four
// threads are meetings, set as the sync sets them, relative to now so Today always has some coming up: "Who owns
// what" later today (with Meera, who is invited, and Dev K., who has no address), the review next Wednesday (with
// Meera and Asha), the meetup a few days out as a day with no time (with Asha and Leela, someone new added by name),
// and pricing for small teams three days ago (with Asha). Three asks, each a thread of his own with a questions page:
// "Tuesday demo", open at hey's /ask/demo-nov-10, answered from 34 browsers (Ravi and Priya by name, Meera with the guest's
// address, whom he invited back to her own thread, and 31 more, a few without a name), its earlier answers marked
// read and the newest still new, so Today folds them into one row and Answered by has enough for Show all and its
// filter; "Founders dinner", a draft at /ask/founders-dinner, which only he can open; and "October meetup", closed,
// whose page reads with no boxes. A journal of three made-up days before today, written as the sync writes them (the
// latest with no page for today yet), with a storyline counting down, one new and one closed, a photo, a hand edit
// that made the latest day's version 2, a typed answer to one day's question, and last week's chapter. Pages are seeded the way the sync saves them, through the threads' call with its
// played token: the sealed probe (test/fixtures/sealed-probe.html, every line of which should read "blocked" in the
// browser), a made-up page that asks questions ("The review on Wednesday", shared with the guest and Asha), with
// answers, a discussion on its words, one on words its second version cut, and replies, and each file given with
// `--page <file>` (an
// artifact's HTML as the Artifact tool's read saved it) as a version of one thread. Requests reach the Worker at
// these local addresses, so the bridge a page carries addresses what it says to them, as it addresses
// hey.donepudi.me live. Nothing here is deployed or reaches Cloudflare: the harness refuses every outside request but Access's
// played keys.
