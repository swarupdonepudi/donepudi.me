// People, run as production runs them: the Worker's bundle in workerd (test/harness.ts), with a local D1 and
// Cloudflare Access played for the threads' application. What it holds: everyone he deals with becomes one person,
// found by the address a visitor typed (ignoring case), on a site note and on a public thread alike, and a visitor's
// typing never renames anyone; a told thread joins the person the sync names by number (a number nobody has is
// refused and nothing is written), else the one person with that name, else a new person; an invitation lands on a
// sender's person, his typed name winning. Linking a visitor's note to a person changes no name anyone else reads.
// The people calls: the owner and the sync read everyone and one person (their threads with how they are in each,
// what they said, newest first, waiting and dropped notes marked); only the owner changes a person (their name,
// their address once, never one another person holds, and his notes on them), from his own page; an invited person
// is refused every call before anything is read, and signed out nobody gets in. Someone only ever in threads he
// dropped is marked so. A search answers people beside threads for the owner and the sync, never for an invited
// person; a thread names who it is from by number, a comment its writer, a thread's people theirs, for the owner
// and the sync only. A person in a meeting counts it (`met`) with the role `met` on its thread, is in touch once it has
// begun, and is live while it is on a thread he hasn't dropped; a name given to a meeting is someone new.
