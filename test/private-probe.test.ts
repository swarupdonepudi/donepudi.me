// The privacy probe the deploy runs (tools/probe/private.ts), driven against a played site on its two hosts: it passes
// when every private call on the threads' host sends a stranger to Access's sign-in or refuses them, every journal
// page is the shell at the threads' root, and the threads' old addresses on the home page's host are gone (404); and
// it fails, naming the address, when a call answers 200, redirects anywhere but Access, a journal page carries anything
// the shell doesn't, or an old address answers anything but 404; it asks every journal address and the threads'
// private calls, with no sign-in and with forged ones. One run of the entry point is not made here, because it asks
// the live site.
