// The bridge every saved page carries (frame/bridge.js), its pure parts, run on Node: importing it runs nothing,
// because its start runs only in a document. What it holds: quoted words are found again by their text either side,
// in a later version too, and are missing once a version cuts them; a selection's words keep their spaces and line
// breaks, with up to 64 characters either side, and a blank one or one over 500 is no quote; and a message from the
// thread is taken only as exactly one of its four kinds, in range, so nothing else the parent posts reaches the page:
// a hello is the signed-in thread's, a public visitor's, an ask's visitor's (whose boxes only Swarup reads) or the
// owner's reading an ask (no boxes to type in), and a save that failed may say why in one short line.
