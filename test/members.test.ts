// Sharing a thread, run as production runs it: the Worker's bundle in workerd (test/harness.ts), with a local D1
// and Cloudflare Access played for the threads' application, an invited person signing in by their own address.
// What it holds: the owner invites a person to a thread and takes the invitation back, from his own page only,
// each with its event, which names the person and never their address; a person is kept once per address; his
// own address is refused. A signed-in address with no invitation that stands is refused at the door with 403
// `caller`, as a stranger always was, and so is a person removed from their last thread. An invitation opens
// exactly one thread: for an invited person, every other thread answers exactly as a number never used, on the
// thread, its page, a comment, a search and their list; and every call that isn't theirs is refused with 403
// `owner-only` before anything is read. What they see of their thread: no visitor's email, origin, issue link,
// drop reason or mail opening, no earlier version of any text, no "Only me" comment, and the people by name only.
// They reply, answer and comment on words, never under an Only me comment, and their own comments are told apart from
// a namesake's by their address, which is never shown. They read a meeting of a thread they are in, its people by name only and its
// history with where it moved from, their own place marked as theirs by their address; being in a meeting grants
// nothing, at the door or at sign-in. The owner's list says how many people each thread is shared with, and which wait on him: an invited person had
// the last word, until he comments, moves or edits. Someone who answered one of his asks and whom he invited back to
// their own thread reads it with the ask's page and their answers, which read as their own (by the address the thread
// was made with) and as nobody else's, answers again there as themselves, never sees who else answered or the ask's
// own thread, and is refused every ask call.
