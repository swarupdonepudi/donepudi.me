// What the asks' pages say (site/app/asks.js). What it holds: an ask's link and its room's address read back by their
// patterns; a row says who can answer or how many did and when; Answered by puts new answers first and then the
// newest, and finds a name or a number; its head counts the people and the new ones; Today folds several new answers
// to one ask into a row that names two and counts the others; a closed ask's Send a note goes to its topic's note
// when a topic opens it; and every ask event has its history words. Today's Waiting on you is folded once, the same
// for its rows, its keyboard walk and the rail's count: one entry per lone response thread, one per ask with several
// new answers, named by the ask's number. Mark read is offered from one new answer. Only he reads that an ask's
// summary is his alone, and the drafts' hint says only he can open one.
