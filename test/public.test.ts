// Public threads, run as production runs them: the Worker's bundle in workerd (test/harness.ts), with a local D1 and
// R2, Turnstile played, and Cloudflare Access played for the private calls. What it holds: making a thread public
// and taking it back are moves, the owner's alone, and only his own threads may be public. Every number that isn't
// a public thread (private, shared with people, a site note, a told thread, missing, not a number) answers the same
// 404 bytes on the thread, its page, its notes and its answers. A public answer holds no email, status, origin,
// people, events, ids, last activity or page source, and only the comments written as Public that are shown. A page
// version is served only while the page is the thread's main section. A visitor's note is shown at once, answers no
// number, is refused once the thread is taken back, and counts against the note flow's daily limits. A visitor's
// answer to a page's question is shown at once too, only while the page is the main section, with a name and a key
// whose hash alone is kept; the newest per question and key is the one that shows, a dropped newest hides that key's
// answer, and a stranger reads other people's answers to a question only once their own key has answered it. Answers
// count against their own daily limits, apart from notes'. Only he drops a visitor's words, shows them again, or
// holds them; members see shown ones and never a waiting or dropped one, an email, or the events that would tell
// them of one, and a visitor's note is never an invited person's own, even sent under their address. A visitor's words make the thread wait on him. The sync never writes for anyone. Nobody replies under
// a public comment or a visitor's note, and invited people's answers, comments on words and replies never reach a
// stranger, nor does a meeting or anyone in it. A public thread's address carries its title and preview tags,
// escaped, with no ETag; a private and a missing number get the shell byte for byte.
