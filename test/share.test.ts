// The owner's Share sheet's words and checks (site/app/share.js). What it holds: an invitation needs an address
// and a one-line name, never his own address and never someone already in the thread; the sheet's lines count
// comments and seats in plain words; and the invitation he sends from his own Gmail names the thread and carries its
// `?invite` link, with no one else's address in it. The Public switch: a thread is Public, Invited or Private; only his
// own threads may be public, and the switch says why not for a site note or a told thread; and a reply to a
// visitor's note on a public thread is a draft to them alone, about that thread, quoting their words. The home page
// switch: only a public thread can be listed, and it says what everyone sees once it is.
