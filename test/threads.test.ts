// The threads' calls under /threads/api/, run as production runs them: the Worker's bundle in workerd
// (test/harness.ts), with a local D1 and Cloudflare Access played for the threads' own application. What it
// holds: a list answers one tab newest number first, 50 at a time, with the number to go on from and every tab's
// count; an add is numbered after the last, once per ref, and numbers stay unique under adds at the same time; the
// owner starts a thread of his own from his page; a thread's call answers it with its comments and its history,
// oldest first; every move by number writes its event in the same transaction, a refused one writes nothing, and
// `reopen`'s event names the status it really went to; a comment and a text (a title, a summary or a main text),
// each from either caller, an edit keeping the text it replaced and leaving `moved_at` alone, and a visitor's own
// words never rewritten; every write stamps the thread's last activity; a search answers a number or words; the
// sign-in sends the owner back only to a threads page; the owner's writes only from his own page, the sync alone
// filing, the owner alone marking his mail opened; a comment's place (a reply under a root that isn't a reply, an
// answer or a visitor's note, in its parent's audience; an answer to a page's question; words of a version the thread
// has, their context kept as selected), never the sync's, each comment saying whose it is. The checks of who gets in (every token Access might be handed,
// the keys) and each move's exact row are test/threads-door.test.ts's.
