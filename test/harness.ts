// The Worker in Cloudflare's own runtime, for the Worker tests (test/talk.test.ts, test/threads-door.test.ts,
// test/threads.test.ts, test/members.test.ts, test/evaluate.test.ts, test/routing.test.ts, test/migrations.test.ts)
// and the signed-in local site (test/dev-signed-in.ts): Miniflare (pinned to the version the
// pinned wrangler itself runs, so the runtime and compatibility date are production's) runs the exact bundle
// `wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir dist` writes, in front of the site's own files with the routing
// wrangler.jsonc declares (which paths reach the code, how the rest are served, and the binding the code hands
// files over through, which applies site/_redirects and site/_headers as the deploy does), with a real local D1 holding
// migrations/, all of them or up to the one a test names, so a test can stage a table as an earlier one left
// it and then apply the rest, and a real local R2 bucket for the pages saved into threads. Turnstile's
// verification is played here: a token of `pass` passes for the host the test last asked (the home page's or the
// threads'), `wrong-host` passes for
// another host, `wrong-action` for another action, `unreachable` answers as a check that is down, and
// anything else fails; under Cloudflare's test secret every token passes, as Cloudflare answers it. Cloudflare
// Access is played too: the team's certs address (wrangler.jsonc's `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN`) serves the harness's
// own RSA keys, and `access.token` signs an application token with them as Access would, for the threads'
// application: the owner's, the sync's, or an invited person's (`memberClaims`). `access.evaluationClaims` are what
// Access sends the site's evaluation door at sign-in (src/evaluate.ts), signed the same way, and the Worker gets
// its own evaluation key (`EVALUATION_KEY`, whose public half the tests verify the answers with). The home page's
// outside sources are played as well (`outside`): his channel's feed (test/fixtures/youtube-feed.xml, made up),
// each product's newest release on GitHub's API, and a video's picture (test/fixtures/thumb.jpg), each of which a test
// may switch to another status, a hang, a malformed or oversized body. `startHarness({ triggers: true })` lets a test
// fire the Worker's hourly run (`scheduled`) through Miniflare's trigger path. Every other host the Worker tries is
// refused and recorded.
