// How the journal's page text is read (site/app/journal.js), the one reader the page and the Worker share, on made-up
// pages in the recorder sync's grammar. What it holds: a day's card (title, subtitle, one line, contents, people, wins,
// storylines with their new and closed marks wherever the line puts them), each story with its title, when and blocks
// (paragraphs, a quote, a photo, a list), a one-story day with no story title, and its close (sitting with, the
// question, still asking, the arrows and the note); a week's chapter prose, its quiet and week-ahead lines, and its
// storylines; a page with no title is none; every unknown margin label is kept; a photo is only ever `photo:<id>`, any
// other source its caption alone; a link to the site opens in place and any other address only when it is http(s);
// the keys are real days and real ISO weeks (53-week years included); the journal's order puts a week just before its
// Sunday; a storyline's countdown is reckoned from the day its line was written, so a later day still counts right,
// moves when a later line moves it, ends when it closes, and is gone once its day has passed.
