// The thread's half of what a page and its thread say to each other (site/app/page-talk.js). What it holds: a
// message from a page's frame is taken only as exactly one of its six kinds, in range, a selection's words with their
// spaces and an answer trimmed; a thread's comments sort into the four places a comment sits, replies under their
// parent; the page is told each person's newest answer, by name and never by address or number, and every
// discussion's words with the one being written; and cards beside the page sit level with their words, pushed down
// where two would overlap. The hello each reader's page is answered with is one of four shapes the bridge takes,
// and a public thread's and a signed-in reader's are the bytes they always were; a page told to be read takes no answer.
