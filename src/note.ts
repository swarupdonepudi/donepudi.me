// The checks everything a visitor writes Swarup passes, in one place, for the site's four public writes: the note
// flow's send (src/talk.ts), a new thread about one of his topics; a note on a public thread; an answer to a
// question of a public thread's page (both src/public.ts), each shown at once; and an answer to an ask (src/asks.ts),
// which only he reads. All come from the site's own page as
// JSON with exactly the string keys their door names, and share one order of refusals, each the cheapest that
// applies: no bot-check secret (503), another origin (403), no or too large a declared length (411, 413), a body that
// isn't JSON (415; a browser form can't send JSON, so this also closes cross-site form posts), a malformed note or
// answer (400), a failed bot check (403), and the daily limits (429, whose `limit` reason the page shows), which every
// note counts against one budget, every answer to a public page against another, and an ask's answers against the
// ask's own two (src/quota.ts). Bots are refused before the
// limits, so they can't spend real visitors' allowance. Nothing personal is ever logged: a refusal's line holds its
// status and reason only.
