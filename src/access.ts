// Who is calling the private door. Cloudflare Access stands in front of hey.donepudi.me/threads/api, its own
// application, and signs every request it lets through (the
// `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header, RS256, with the team's keys). This module checks that signature itself, with
// the runtime's WebCrypto and no library, and then names who it is: the owner, by the email the sign-in proved,
// the recorder sync, by its service token's client id, or, for any other email the sign-in proved, a candidate,
// whom the door admits only when that address has an invitation that stands (src/threads.ts, src/store.ts
// `isInvited`): this check reads no database, so it stays a pure check of Access's signature. The door names its
// application's audience tag, so a token Access signed for any other application never opens it. Anything Access
// didn't sign for that application is refused, so a request that slipped past the edge's path match (a changed
// case, an encoded slash) still meets this check. The signature and time checks are also the ones the answer to
// Access's sign-in question uses (src/evaluate.ts), on a token that is not an application's and names no issuer.
//
// The keys are fetched from the team's certs address and kept in the isolate. A token naming a key the
// isolate doesn't hold fetches them again, which is how Cloudflare's key rotation arrives, but at most once a
// minute, so a stream of made-up key ids can't turn the Worker into a fetcher. A failed fetch keeps nothing,
// so the next request tries again. The checks follow Cloudflare's
// "Validate JWTs" page (developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/
// authorization-cookie/validating-json/) and its application-token page for the claims.
