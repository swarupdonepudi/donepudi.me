// The journal's calls under /threads/api/journal, behind the threads' Access application and the door's own check of

//   GET  /threads/api/journal                     owner and sync: every entry's newest version, indexed, newest first
//   GET  /threads/api/journal/<key>[?version=n]   owner and sync: its text (the newest, or version n), every version,
//                                                 and a day's typed answers
//   POST /threads/api/journal/<key>   {"text", "base"}   owner (a hand edit, from his own page) and sync: a new version
//   POST /threads/api/journal/<day>/answers   {"body"}   owner, from his own page: an answer to the day's question
//   POST /threads/api/journal/photos              a JPEG or PNG   sync: a photo a page may show
//   GET  /threads/api/journal/photos/<id>         owner and sync: the photo itself
//   GET  /threads/api/journal/storylines          owner and sync: every storyline's trail across the days
//
// A key is a real calendar day (`2026-11-06`) or ISO week (`2026-W44`); anything else answers 404 `no-entry`, the
// same bytes as a day never written. An entry is the whole page text in the sync's grammar (site/app/journal.js,
// which reads it here to index it, as the page reads it to draw it), stored byte for byte as sent, at most 64,000
// characters and 100 storylines, and it must have a `## ` title (400 `journal`). A photo it shows is `photo:<id>` of a
// photo already uploaded, at most 100 of them (400 `photo` otherwise).
// A save that fails for any other reason fails as itself, never as stale, so nothing retries it for ever. Every save names the version it was built on (`base`, 0 for a new entry): while
// that is still the newest, the save is version `base + 1` (201); otherwise nothing is written and the answer is 409
// `stale` with the newest version, so the sync reads, rebuilds and saves again, and a hand edit is never lost. Every
// version is kept for good. An answer is at most 4,000 characters, on a day that has an entry (404 `no-entry`); all
// are kept, the newest is the answer, and an empty one takes it back.
//
// A photo is uploaded as its own bytes, its declared length at most 4 MiB, its declared type `image/jpeg` or
// `image/png`, and its first bytes that type's signature (415 `type` otherwise), because it is served as itself. The
// object goes into the private pages bucket first, under a fresh key, then its row; when the row isn't kept the object
// is deleted again. It is served with its stored type, `nosniff`, a sandboxing CSP, and `Cache-Control: private,
// max-age=31536000, immutable`, because a photo never changes: the Worker's one answer of this kind beside the two
// AGENTS.md names.
