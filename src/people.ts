// The people calls under /threads/api/people, behind the threads' Access application and the door's own check of
// who is calling (src/threads.ts routes here once the caller is named): everyone Swarup deals with, each a person
// with a number (src/store.ts, migrations/0012_people.sql): people he invited, visitors who wrote to him from the
// site or on a public thread with an address, and people who told him something in person.
//
//   GET  /threads/api/people              owner and sync: everyone, whoever was last in touch first
//   GET  /threads/api/people/<n>          owner and sync: one person, their threads and what they said
//   POST /threads/api/people/<n>          {"name"} | {"email"} | {"note"}   owner
//
// A person's page holds what other people said to him, so only he and the sync read it, and only he changes it,
// from his own page: an invited person is refused 403 `owner-only` on every call, and the sync on a change, before
// anything is read, so the refusal says nothing about a number. A number nobody has answers 404 `no-person`.
//
// Everyone is answered whoever was last in touch first, each with how he knows them (the counts) and whether
// anything of theirs is live (`dropped` when it isn't: only ever in threads he dropped). A person's call adds his
// own notes on them, every thread they are in with how (`roles`: `sent` a site note, `told` him, `invited`, their
// invitation `removed`, `wrote` a comment or note there, `met` in its meeting), shaped as the threads' calls shape a
// thread, its meeting included, and what they said, newest first: their site notes, their comments as an invited
// person, and their notes on public threads with whether each is waiting or dropped. Up to 200 of each; `truncated`
// says there are more. The counts include the meetings they are in (`met`).
//
// A change is one field: their name; their address, given once while they have none (lowercased, never his own,
// 409 `has-email` once they have one, 409 `email-taken` with the number of the person who holds it), because it is
// what an invited person signs in with; or his notes on them, Markdown, which an empty text clears. Nothing about a
// person has a history: a person isn't a thread, and his notes are his own words. Nothing personal is logged.
