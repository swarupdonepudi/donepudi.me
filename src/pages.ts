// The threads page's addresses on the threads' host (hey.donepudi.me, site/hosts.js), which the Worker answers
// because no file can sit at every thread's number: the rooms, each at the top level beside the others: the root, /
// (the door everyone signed in enters by: Today for the owner, their threads for an invited person), /meetings, /threads/ (the list, with its tab and space in the query), and the
// people pages, /people and /people/<n> with the person's name after it or not (/people/7-meera), which read nothing:
// the asks, /asks, which reads nothing either; an ask's own address, /ask/<slug>, which anyone opens to answer it;
// a person's address gets the plain shell whatever the number, so it never says whether that person exists; and a
// thread, /threads/<n>, with its title after the number or not (/threads/42-who-owns-what); and Swarup's journal, /journal with a day, a week or the storylines under it,
// which reads nothing either. People lived under
// /threads/ before the rooms were peers: /threads/people and every person's address there redirect to /people for
// good, and /people/ to /people. Each gets the one page, site/threads/index.html,
// handed over from the site's own files through the assets binding, so it carries site/_headers (the CSP among
// them) exactly as a file served straight from site/ would. The status is 200 whatever the number: the page asks
// the calls for the thread, and a missing thread, a thread this browser may not read and a signed-out visitor all
// see the same "Nothing here", so the address alone never tells whether a thread exists.
//
// A link preview (Slack, iMessage) reads only this HTML, so a public thread's address gets its own title and
// preview tags: at a thread's address the Worker reads the thread's row with one indexed query whatever the number
// (`publicPreview`), so a private, a missing and a public number cost the same, and only a public thread's answer
// differs. Its title, `og:` and `twitter:` tags are written as text or escaped attributes, never as markup; the
// description is plain text from the site's own Markdown reader (site/app/markdown.js): the living summary, else the
// first paragraph of the text when the text is what the thread shows. That answer is fetched without the browser's
// conditional headers and carries no ETag, because the shell's ETag would let a browser keep a stale title, or the
// plain shell, as a 304. Every other answer is the shell byte for byte. The `noindex` stays on every thread: a
// public thread is kept out of search results, and found by its link. Any other path under /threads/ is answered by
// the site's files as it would be without the Worker: the 404 page, or a clean-address redirect. The page's
// scripts live under /app/, outside the Worker's paths, so they cost no Worker request.
//
// An ask's address gets its preview the same way, read by its slug with one indexed query whatever the slug
// (`findAsk`), while the ask is open or closed: its title, which is written for strangers, and a fixed line, "A few
// questions from Swarup", never the thread's living summary, which is his private label, nor its number. A draft and a
// slug no thread has get the shell byte for byte.
