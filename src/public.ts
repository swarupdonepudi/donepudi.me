//
//   GET  /api/threads/<n>                    the thread, its page's versions and its public comments
//                                            [X-Visitor-Key: <the visitor's key>]
//   GET  /api/threads/<n>/pages/<version>    one version of its page, while the page is its main section
//   POST /api/threads/<n>/notes              {"body", "name", "email", "token"}: a note, shown at once

//
// A thread is public when he made it so and it is his own (src/store.ts holds the condition in every query). Any
// other number (private, shared with people, a site note, a told thread, missing, not a number) answers the same
// 404 `no-thread` on each call, so the public calls tell a stranger nothing about threads they can't read. What a
// public thread says is a few of the fields the private call gives, under the same names, so the threads page draws
// one shape: never its status, source, sender, origin, people, history, ids or last activity, which a visitor's
// words move; and its comments are those written as Public that are shown, each by author and name only, with the
// question an answer answers and whether it is the reader's own.
//
// A note runs every visitor note's checks (src/note.ts), the bot check before the thread is read, and counts against
// the same daily limits as the note flow's. It is kept as a comment for anyone, shown at once, with the name and
// email the visitor typed, and answers `{}`: no id or number. An answer runs the same checks in the same order, with
// a name it must have and no email, and counts against the answers' own daily limits; a thread takes answers only
// while its page is its main section, any other answering the same 404. Its `key` is 32 random bytes as hex that the
// visitor's browser made once and keeps; only its SHA-256 is kept, so answering again from that browser is a new
// answer that shows in place of the last one, and nobody else can replace it. The read takes the same key from
// `X-Visitor-Key`, never a cookie, to say which answers are the reader's own (`mine`), and the store returns other
// people's answers to a question only once that key has answered it (src/store.ts, `historyPublic`). Every answer carries `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`,
// because a public thread is kept out of search results; it is found by its link. Nothing personal is logged.
