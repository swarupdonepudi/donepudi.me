// The Worker's code, on two hosts (site/hosts.js): the home page's, donepudi.me, and the threads', one label below
// it at hey.donepudi.me, where everything behind the door lives. It runs only for the paths `run_worker_first`
// names in wrangler.jsonc, and splits by host first, then by path; every other path is a file from site/ on either
// host. On the home page's host it answers the home page, /, with what Swarup posted written in, every update at
// /updates, its feed, /feed.xml (src/home.ts), its videos' pictures, /thumbs/* (src/outside.ts), and POST /api/talk, the note flow's public send
// (src/talk.ts). On the threads' host it answers the threads' private calls under /threads/api/ (src/threads.ts),
// behind their Cloudflare Access application and the Worker's own check of the caller against its tag; under
// /api/access/, the site's answer to Access's sign-in question for invited people, with the public key it is signed
// with (src/evaluate.ts), which Access calls itself and so are outside the application; a thread Swarup made public,
// read and a note sent on it under /api/threads/ (src/public.ts), outside Access too, with no sign-in; an ask, a
// questions page anyone answers by its link, read and answered under /api/asks/ (src/asks.ts), outside Access too;
// and the threads page (src/pages.ts) at its root, Today, the door everyone signed in enters by, at the rooms
// (/meetings, /asks, /people and a person under it, /journal and everything under it), at an ask's own address
// (/ask/<slug>) and at every other path under /threads/, handed over from site/ with no sign-in, because Access
// guards the calls, never a thread's page. The calls are matched first, so no call ever reaches the pages. Every
// other path the code runs for answers the same JSON 404 on either host, so the threads' old addresses on the home
// page's host (/threads/42, /ask/<slug>, /journal) lead nowhere. It also runs every hour on a cron trigger
// (wrangler.jsonc): `scheduled` fetches his videos and the products' releases into the home page's list
// (src/outside.ts), and awaits the run itself, so Cloudflare's record of each run says how it ended.
