// The home page's feed: what Swarup posts, and what arrives from outside on its own (his full YouTube episodes and the
// newest Planton and Speaking releases, src/outside.ts), written into the site's own home page as one newest-first
// list (its newest ten, then "All updates" when there are more), every item at /updates, and the newest twenty as an
// Atom feed at /feed.xml; and his Now line, the one line under his greeting, which he
// sets from Today through a private call.
//
// `/` is site/index.html, handed over from the site's own files through the assets binding, so it carries
// site/_headers (the CSP among them) exactly as the file served straight from site/ would. The Worker reads the
// newest posted threads, the newest outside items and the Now line in one batch (`homeFeed`, src/store.ts), merges
// the two lists by date (`merged`), and writes them in with `HTMLRewriter`: the Now line as text into
// `[data-now-text]`, and each item as markup built here, in which every value (title, excerpt, date, address, count)
// goes through `attribute`, which escapes all five characters, so it is safe as text and inside an attribute alike.
// The items carry classes only, never a `style` attribute, which the CSP's `style-src 'self'` would refuse. The
// sections the feed fills are `hidden` in the file, and the rewrite shows each one only when it has something to show;
// with no post, no outside item and no Now line, or when the read fails, the answer is the file byte for byte, its
// ETag included, so a deploy before anything is listed changes nothing anyone sees. A rewritten
// answer is fetched without the browser's conditional headers and answered without an ETag, as a public thread's
// preview is (src/pages.ts), so no browser keeps a home page from before a post.
//
// An item is a posted thread: its title (`#<n>` when it has none), its first block as plain text read with the site's
// own Markdown reader (never the living summary, which is his private grid of what is decided and open), the day he
// posted it in his own zone, how many notes a stranger reads under it (shown only above zero), and its address: the
// thread's, or its `?full` address when its main section is a page, so a reader lands on the page full screen, always
// on the threads' host (hey.donepudi.me, built from the request's own origin by site/hosts.js), because threads
// live there and this host answers none of their addresses. Only
// public threads are ever posted, and the feed's query holds that in its own SQL, so strangers read here only what
// they could read at the thread's own address. A video is its title, its day, "Watch on YouTube" and, once the hourly
// run copied it, its picture from the site's own `/thumbs/<id>.jpg`, versioned by the video's `updated` so a changed
// picture gets a new address; the picture links where the title does, out of the tab and reading order, so a keyboard
// or screen-reader user meets each video once. A release is "Planton 0.1.2", its day and "Release notes", with no
// excerpt, because release notes open with an install block or a list of pull requests.
//
// /feed.xml is the same items as an Atom feed, with a fixed id per item (`tag:donepudi.me,2026:thread-<n>`,
// `…:video/<id>`, `…:release/<owner>/<repo>/<tag>`, so a new release is a new entry though the page keeps one row per
// product), so a reader never sees one item twice, everything escaped as XML text, kept out of search results like the
// threads themselves (`X-Robots-Tag: noindex`), and cacheable for five minutes. With nothing listed it is a valid
// empty feed.
//
// The Now line's call, /threads/api/now, is the owner's alone, both ways: `GET` reads the line, `POST {"text"}` sets
// it, only from his own page (src/request.ts). The sync and an invited person are refused with 403 `owner-only`
// before anything is read, as the people calls refuse invited people. The text is one line of at most 140 characters
// (`readNowLine`, src/wire.ts; 400 `now` otherwise), and an empty one takes the line off the home page. Every line is
// kept (migrations/0018_feed.sql).
