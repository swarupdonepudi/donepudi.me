// What arrives on the home page from outside, with no act of his: his full YouTube episodes and the newest release of
// Planton and of Agent Tabs, each already public where it comes from. A cron trigger (wrangler.jsonc) runs
// `refreshOutside` every hour; it keeps what it reads in its own table (src/outside-store.ts), which the home page and
// its feed merge with his posts (src/home.ts). And `/thumbs/<id>.jpg`, a video's picture, copied by the run into the
// pages bucket and served from the site itself, so a visitor's browser asks nobody else for anything.
//
// Every source is fetched on its own, with a timeout and a bounded read, and a source that fails in any way (an error
// status, a timeout, a body over its cap, an answer that doesn't parse, or one holding entries none of which is valid)
// keeps its rows exactly as they were, so a flaky or changed source never empties the list; the others still run.
//
// - The channel's feed (no key) lists its newest 15 uploads. A Short, told apart only by its `/shorts/` link, is cut
//   from an episode and is never listed, but still counts toward the feed's window: a row the answer leaves out,
//   published at or after the oldest entry it holds, was taken down or unlisted and is dropped. An older one can't be
//   seen to go and stays. Every value is checked, every date stored with Z, and the watch address rebuilt from the id.
// - Each product's newest release is GitHub's `releases/latest` (neither a draft nor a pre-release), called without a
//   key. It is kept only when its tag is short and printable and its address is the one rebuilt from the tag in its own
//   repository; its title is the product's name and the tag ("Planton 0.1.2"), never the release's own name. A 404 (no
//   release any more) drops the row.
// - Pictures: up to `PICTURES_PER_RUN` episodes without one, newest first, get YouTube's 320×180 picture copied, one at
//   a time, kept only when it is a JPEG by its first bytes and at most `MAX_PICTURE_BYTES`. A failed copy leaves the
//   item without a picture until the next run. Last, the bucket is reconciled to the table: every picture whose video
//   has no row is deleted, so a taken-down video's picture is gone within the run.
//
// One run spends at most 30 of the 50 subrequests a run may make: three sources, ten pictures fetched and ten kept,
// one list, one delete, five database calls. Each source logs one JSON line with its name, numbers and a reason word;
// the log helper takes nothing else, so no title or address reaches a log line.
//
// The picture's address answers GET and HEAD for exactly `/thumbs/<11-character id>.jpg` whose object exists, with
// its query ignored (the page versions the address with `?v=`, so a changed picture gets a new one), and the same
// JSON 404 as an unknown path for anything else. It is public, as the home page is, and cached for good.
