// The note flow's send, the site's first public write: a typed note about one of Swarup's topics, with an
// optional name and email, kept as a new thread (src/store.ts, which links it to the person that address is), from
// the site's own page, as JSON with exactly five string keys. Its checks and their order are every visitor note's
// (src/note.ts): no bot-check secret (503), another origin (403), no or too large a declared length (411, 413), a
// body that isn't JSON (415), a malformed note (400; the topic is checked right after the shape), a failed bot check
// (403), and the daily limits (429). Nothing personal is ever logged: a refusal's line holds its status and reason
// only.
