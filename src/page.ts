// A page saved into a thread, as its frame on the threads page loads it: the Worker's one answer that isn't JSON.
// A page is a Claude artifact's own HTML, so it runs its own scripts, styles and libraries; it is shown at its
// thread's own call address (GET /threads/api/threads/<n>/pages/<version>, behind Access and the Worker's check of
// the caller, src/threads.ts) and sealed by its response's headers rather than by a second domain:
//
// - The CSP's `sandbox` puts the document in an opaque origin, as though framed with a sandbox attribute, so it
//   can't read the site's cookies or storage, reach the parent's document or move the top window. It allows
//   scripts, forms (their handlers; `form-action 'none'` blocks every real submission) and popups that open as
//   ordinary tabs (a link with target=_blank). The threads page frames it with the same tokens.
// - The CSP's sources are claude.ai's own page contract and no wider: inline script and style, scripts from the
//   five script hosts that contract names, Google Fonts, images and media as data: or blob:, Web Workers from
//   blob:, and no connection anywhere (`connect-src 'none'`), so a page can't send what it shows, or call the
//   threads' calls with the owner's cookie. `frame-ancestors 'self'` lets only the site frame it. An artifact that
//   needs more (claude.ai's runtime, several files, compiling in the browser) is kept as a link instead.
// - The bridge (frame/bridge.js, as text in src/frame-bridge.ts) is added at the document's end, after a JSON script
//   naming the site's own origin (from the request, never `*`), which is where it addresses everything it says. It
//   tells the parent the page's height, so the frame grows to fit and the thread scrolls as one; in a signed-in
//   thread it also draws answer boxes under the page's questions and marks the words its discussions are on, and
//   it never saves anything itself. Both are inline scripts, which the CSP already allows; nothing widens.
// - A version never changes, so the answer is cached and revalidated (`private, no-cache`) with an ETag built from
//   the object's own and the bridge's version (a hash of its text): opening a thread again costs a 304, every open
//   still passes Access and the Worker's check, and a deploy that changes the bridge is never answered from a stale
//   copy.
//
// A document that doesn't start with `<!doctype` gets the skeleton claude.ai wraps every published page in, when
// it is saved (`withSkeleton`), so a file written by hand looks as it would on claude.ai.
