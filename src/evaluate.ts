// Cloudflare Access's question at sign-in, answered by the site: may this email address sign in to the threads?
// The threads' Access application has a third policy, after the owner's and the sync's, whose one rule is an
// external evaluation (infrastructure/planton/planton.ai/Infra.prod.CloudflareZeroTrustAccessPolicy.
// donepudi-me-threads-members.yaml): Access posts `{"token": <JWT>}` here, signed with the team's own keys and
// naming the address that asked for a code (`identity.email`) and a `nonce`; the answer is `{"token": <JWT>}`,
// signed RS256 with the site's own evaluation key, carrying `success`, `iat`, `exp` and the same nonce. Access
// counts anything else as no. The shapes follow Cloudflare's external evaluation page
// (developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/external-evaluation/) and its example Worker
// (github.com/cloudflare/workers-access-external-auth-example, `index.js` at 615d6f65).
//
//   POST /api/access/evaluate   {"token": <Access's JWT>}   answers {"token": <the site's JWT>}
//   GET  /api/access/keys       the evaluation key's public half, as {"keys": [<JWK>]}; `/api/access/keys/` too
//
// Yes means the address has an invitation that stands, to any thread: `isInvited` in src/store.ts, the same
// question the threads' door asks of every invited caller (src/threads.ts), so the edge and the Worker can't
// disagree about who is invited. The owner is let in by his own policy before this one is asked, and the sync
// never signs in by email. The token is checked by src/access.ts's own signature and time checks, and nothing
// else about where it came from: as Access sent it on 2026-11-05 it carries `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `identity`,
// `nonce` and `request_url`, and no `iss` (an application token's issuer check refused the first live sign-in),
// and the page names neither its audience nor its issuer. A token only the team's keys can sign, naming an address
// and a nonce, answers one yes-or-no about that address. An application token sent here has no `identity` or
// `nonce`, so it is refused. A signed token missing either, or out of its times, logs the check it failed and its
// claims' names (never a value), so a sign-in that fails because Access's shape changes says how on the first
// try. Every answer logs only whether it said yes.
//
// The evaluation key is the Worker secret THREADS_EVALUATION_KEY, an RSA private key as a JWK, handed over by the
// deploy from the GitHub environment `production`; its public half is derived from it here, with every private
// part left out, and named by its RFC 7638 thumbprint, so there is no second copy to drift. Without it, both
// addresses answer 503, which Access counts as no.
