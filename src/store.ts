// The store: every thread Swarup keeps, whatever door it came through. A thread is one row in `threads` with a
// number people can say out loud (#42); its history is its rows in `events`, and the words added to it are its
// rows in `comments` (migrations/0006_threads.sql). Two doors write here: the note flow (src/talk.ts), and the
// threads' calls (src/threads.ts), which the owner's page and the recorder sync use. Each door turns its own wire
// into the intents below, so the rules live here once.
//
// Every write that changes a thread writes its event in the same batch, which D1 runs as one transaction: the
// event is an INSERT ... SELECT from the row under the same guard as the change, ahead of the change, so it
// reads the row as it was, and both apply or neither does. A move states its new status once, as one SQL
// expression on the row, and both statements use it, so the event names the status the row really went to.
// A thread's number is one more than the largest, given inside its INSERT; D1 runs one query at a time, and the
// UNIQUE constraint turns any duplicate into an error rather than two #42s. Every write also stamps the thread's
// last activity (`activity_at`, migrations/0008_activity.sql) in the same batch: an arrival, a move, an edit, a
// comment, a page saved, a link set. This file is its only writer, so the rule lives here once.
//
// A thread's main section (`main`, migrations/0009_pages.sql) is its text, a page or a link, whichever was attached
// last. A page's versions are rows in `pages`, each naming its object in the private bucket by a fresh key; the
// bucket is the threads' calls' to write (src/threads.ts), before the row, and this file only keeps the rows.
//
// A thread may be shared with people Swarup invites (`people` and `members`, migrations/0010_members.sql). Every
// read and the one write an invited person may make (a comment) take a `Reader`: the owner and the sync see every
// thread, and an invited person only the threads they have an invitation to that stands, by one SQL condition
// (`readable`) on the query itself. A thread they aren't in is a row the query can't see, so a door answers it
// exactly as a number never used. Their comments see only what everyone in the thread may (`audience`), so the
// owner's "Only me" comments never reach them. Who may call at all is asked of the same tables (`isInvited`), by
// the threads' door and by the answer Cloudflare Access is given at sign-in (src/evaluate.ts), so the two can't
// disagree about who is invited.
//
// One of his own threads may also be public (`public_at`, migrations/0011_public.sql): anyone reads it, with no
// sign-in, through the public calls (src/public.ts), which ask their own queries here (`findPublic`,
// `historyPublic`, `findPublicPage`, `publicPreview`), each holding the public condition (`PUBLIC`) in its own SQL.
// A stranger sees only the comments written as Public that are shown. A visitor may send a note on a public thread
// (`addNote`), and answer the questions of its page while the page is its main section (`addAnswer`,
// migrations/0015_visitor_answers.sql): each is a comment for anyone, shown at once, and only he drops it, or shows
// it again (`judgeNote`). A visitor's answer carries the hash of a key their browser keeps (`visitor_key`): answering
// again from it is a new answer, and the newest per question and key is the one that shows (a dropped newest hides
// that key's answer, never bringing back an older one). A stranger reads other people's answers to a question only
// once their own key has answered it (`historyPublic`), so nobody's answer is shaped by the ones before it.
//
// A public thread may also be on his home page (`feed_at`, migrations/0018_feed.sql), a second act of his (`post`,
// `unpost`), so making a thread readable by its link never lists it for everyone who opens the site. Taking a thread
// back from public takes it off the home page in the same statement. The home page reads the newest posted threads
// and the Now line, his one line under the greeting, in one batch (`homeFeed`); the Now line is a history of rows, the
// newest of which is the line (`nowLine`, `setNowLine`).
//
// Everyone he deals with is a person (`people`, migrations/0012_people.sql), numbered as threads are: the people he
// invites, a visitor who wrote from the site or on a public thread with an address, and someone who told him
// something in person. Who a site note or a told thread is from is `threads.person_id`; who wrote an invited
// person's comment or a visitor's note is `comments.person_id`. The person is found or made here, once, in the same
// batch as the write that names them: by the address a visitor typed, lowercased (a visitor's typing never renames
// anyone, so a person made from it is named by what they typed only when new); for a told thread by the person
// number the sync names, else by the told name when exactly one person has it (trimmed, ignoring case), else a new
// person; and an invitation by the address it names, so a person who wrote from the site and is then invited is one
// person, his typed name winning. A comment shows an invited person's name as it stands, and a visitor's as they
// typed it, so linking a note to a person changes nothing anyone else reads. People are his alone to read with the
// sync and to change (`editPerson`): their name, their address while they have none, and his own notes on them.
//
// A comment may sit somewhere other than the thread itself (migrations/0013_anchors.sql): under another comment (a
// reply), as an answer to a question of the thread's page, or on words of a version of the page. `comment` checks
// the place in its own INSERT, under the same reader as the thread: a reader replies only under a comment they can
// see, so an invited person never replies under "Only me", and a reply takes its parent's audience.
//
// Any thread may also be one meeting (migrations/0014_meetings.sql), once it has a when: a day, its time not set yet,
// or an instant in UTC, with a length and a where if said, and the people who will be in the room (`attendees`).
// Being in a meeting grants nothing: an attendee is not a member, so it never opens the thread or answers yes at
// sign-in, and someone with no address can be one. Every row carries its meeting's people by number and name
// (`meeting_people`), so a meeting reads the same in every list, search and answer. `setMeeting` sets or clears the
// meeting, a change of time keeping where it moved from (`from`, as a move does), and clearing it takes its people
// off with it; `attend` and `unattend` change who is in it. A name given to `attend` always makes a new person,
// because both callers hold the people list already and say a number for anyone they know.
//
// One of his own threads whose main section is a page may also be an ask (migrations/0016_asks.sql): a questions page
// handed to many people by one link, /ask/<slug> (src/asks.ts). `makeAsk` makes it a draft under a slug, which never
// changes; `setAskState` opens it (his alone, the door holds that) and closes it, each with its event. An ask's thread
// is never public and never given a link, so its page stays its main section and strangers read only what the ask
// calls say. Each browser that answers gets a thread of its own, a site note (`source` `talk`, with every protection a
// site note has: never public, its words never rewritten) naming the ask (`ask_thread_id`), with the ask's title and
// space, an empty body, and the ask's page as its main section: `answerAsk` keeps the answer and, the first time, the
// thread, in one batch, one thread per ask and browser by its origin (`ask:<the ask's id>:<the key's hash>`), and holds
// the ask being open in each insert's own SQL, so an answer racing a close is kept nowhere. A response thread's pages
// are its ask's (`COALESCE(ask_thread_id, id)` wherever pages are read), and it is never given a page or a link of its
// own. Its answers carry its person, so a person's page shows them (`wordsOfPerson`).
