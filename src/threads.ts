// An invited person reads only the threads they are in: every read takes the caller as its reader, and the
// store's queries see no other thread, so one they aren't in answers 404 `no-thread`, exactly as a number never
// used. Every call that isn't theirs (a move, a text, a link, a page, a meeting, an add, a tab's list, the people) is refused
// with 403 `owner-only` before anything is read, so the refusal says nothing about a number. What they see of a
// thread is shaped here (`thread`, `commentView`, `eventView`): never a visitor's email, the origin, the issue
// link, a drop reason, the owner's mail opening or an earlier version of any text, and never an "Only me"
// comment (`audience` `owner`, which only the owner and the sync may write). The people on a thread are the
// owner's to change, from his own page: the sync never invites anyone, because an invitation grants access.
//
// A list answers one tab (site/app/standing.js names them: pending, every open thread; look, act and discuss, each
// open status alone; done), newest number first, 50 at a time, with the number to go on from and every tab's count;
// each row also says how many people the thread is shared with (`shared`) and whether its last word is an invited
// person's (`waiting`, which the owner's Today shows). `me` says who is calling, and to the owner and invited people
// their own address (the owner's page needs it to open Gmail as him). The sync's add (src/wire.ts)
// answers the thread already there when its `ref` comes again; the owner's add is a thread he starts from his page, with a title, a space and an open tab. A thread's
// own call answers it with its comments and its history, oldest first, up to 500 of each. A move is one of the
// store's moves (src/store.ts), which holds their rules. A comment adds Markdown to a
// thread. A text replaces the thread's title, its living summary (an empty one clears it) or its main text,
// keeping the text it replaced in the history; a visitor's own words are never rewritten (409 `visitor-words`).
// Text has its own call because a move is capped at 1 KiB. A search answers up to 20 threads for ⌘K: the one
// with that number, or those whose title, summary or text hold the words. The sign-in is where the page sends a
// signed-out owner: Access signs him in at the edge before the call arrives, and the call sends him on to the
// threads page he came from (Today, /, when it names none), never anywhere else. A thread's main section is its text, a page or a link (`main`):
// a page is a Claude artifact's own HTML, which the sync saves as a new version (the object in the private bucket
// first, then its row, the object deleted again when the row isn't kept) and the threads page frames from its own
// address, sealed by that answer's headers (src/page.ts); a link is an address on claude.ai, for an artifact that
// only works there, and an empty one clears it. Every thread answers its last activity (`activityAt`). The
// owner's writes must come from his own page; `reply-opened` is his alone and `file` the sync's. Nothing
// personal is logged: a refusal's line holds its status and reason only.
//
// One of his own threads may be public: `publish` and `unpublish` are moves, his alone, and a thread that isn't his
// own (a site note, a told thread) is never published (409 `not-his-words`). Every reader's thread says when it was
// made public (`publicAt`). A public thread may also be on his home page: `post` and `unpost` are moves, his alone
// too, a thread that isn't public is never posted (409 `not-public`), and unpublishing takes it off; every reader's
// thread says when it was posted (`feedAt`). A comment's audience is the writer's own choice: `public` (anyone, on a public thread
// only, 409 `not-public` elsewhere) from the owner or an invited person, never from the sync, so nothing it
// transcribes is published without him. A visitor's note on a public thread, and a visitor's answer to its page's
// questions (src/public.ts), are shown at once: he drops either at its own address, or shows it again (the page's
// Undo), and the owner's list says a thread waits on him when a visitor wrote last. An invited person never reads words that aren't shown, and nobody but
// the owner and the sync ever reads a visitor's email. A visitor's answer names the key it came from (`visitor`, the
// first 16 hex characters of the key's hash), so the page shows each visitor's newest answer apart from another
// visitor who typed the same name; it can't be used to answer as anyone.
//
// Everyone he deals with is a person with a number (src/people.ts holds their calls). To the owner and the sync, a
// thread names the person it is from (`senderNumber`), a comment its writer's (`personNumber`), a thread's people
// theirs (`number`), and a search answers the people whose name or address holds the words beside the threads
// (`people`), so a name on his page opens that person. An invited person's shapes gain none of these, and every
// people call refuses them. The sync's add may name a told thread's teller by number (`person`); a number nobody
// has is refused 404 `no-person`, and nothing is written.
//
// Any thread may be one meeting, and every thread says so (`meeting`, null while it isn't one): its when, a day
// (`2026-11-09`, its time not set) or an instant in UTC that each reader shows in their own zone, its length and
// where, and the people who will be in the room (`attendees`), in one order for every reader, by name. The owner
// and the sync set and clear it, and add and remove its people: being in a meeting grants nothing, so an attendee
// is never invited, can't sign in for it, and may be someone with no address, added by name as someone new
// (`{"name"}` always makes a new person; a person already known is added by number). Clearing a meeting takes its
// people off with it. Invited people read the meeting of a thread they are in, its people by name only (their own
// entry marked `you`), and its
// history's events with where a meeting moved from; strangers on a public thread never read it (src/public.ts).
// Refusals: 400 `meeting` or `attendee` for a malformed call; 404 `no-thread`, `no-person`; 409 `not-a-meeting` for
// a thread with no when, `not-attending` for removing someone who isn't in it.
//
// One of his own threads whose main section is a page may be an ask, a questions page anyone answers by one link,
// /ask/<slug> (src/asks.ts), each browser that answers getting a thread of its own. The owner and the sync make one a
// draft under a slug (`ask`, 400 `ask` for a malformed call; 409 `slug-taken`, `not-his-words`, `no-page`, `public`,
// `an-ask` for one already an ask); opening it puts it before strangers, so it is his alone, from his own page, as
// `publish` is (403 `owner-only` to the sync); either may close it (409 `not-an-ask`, `not-from-here`). Mark read is
// his alone too, from his own page: one `ask-read` event of his on each response thread that waits on him now, so it
// stops waiting, answered with how many were marked (`{"marked": n}`; 409 `not-an-ask` on any thread that isn't an
// ask's own), with no undoing it, because events are never deleted. Every thread
// says whether it is one (`ask`: `{slug, state}` on an ask's own thread, `{number, slug, title}` of the ask a response
// thread answers, the number for the owner and the sync alone; null otherwise), and an ask's own thread answers who
// answered it (`answeredBy`, by thread number, name, when, and whether it waits on him) to the owner and the sync. An ask's thread is never
// published (409 `an-ask`) or given a link (409 `an-ask`), so its page stays its main section; a response thread is
// never given a page or a link of its own (409 `asked`), because its page is its ask's, which it shows to everyone
// in it. The asks' list answers every ask with how many answered, when last, and the Send a note topic that opens
// it, if any (site/talk-topics.js). Invited people are refused every ask call with 403 `owner-only`.
