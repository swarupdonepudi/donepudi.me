// The asks' public calls, outside Cloudflare Access: an ask is one of Swarup's own threads whose main section is a
// questions page, handed to many people by one link, /ask/<slug>, which anyone answers with no sign-in. Each browser
// that answers gets a thread of its own in his inbox, and nobody but him (and anyone he invites back to that thread)
// ever reads what it said. The request's cookies are never read.
//
//   GET  /api/asks/<slug>                   the ask, its page's versions, and this browser's own answers
//                                           [X-Visitor-Key: <the visitor's key>]
//   GET  /api/asks/<slug>/pages/<version>   one version of its page
//   POST /api/asks/<slug>/answers           {"question", "body", "name", "email", "token", "key"}: an answer
//
// An ask is read while it is open or closed: a closed one says so, with its page, so an old link isn't a dead end,
// and refuses answers with 409 `closed`. A draft and a slug no thread has answer the same 404 `no-ask` bytes on every
// call. What the read says is the ask's slug, its title (written for strangers: the one thing about its thread a
// stranger reads), its state and its page's versions: never its summary, which is his private label, its number, id,
// space or history, nor anyone's answers but the reader's own browser's (`answers`, the newest per question, read
// from that browser's own thread by the key in `X-Visitor-Key`).
//
// An answer runs every visitor answer's checks in the same order (src/note.ts), with a name and an email both
// optional, as a note's: the shape, the bot check, then the ask (404 `no-ask`, 409 `closed`), then the asks' own daily
// budgets (src/quota.ts), apart from the notes' and the public pages' answers': the answer that makes this browser's
// thread counts first against `askThreads` (100 a day from one network, 500 in all), which caps how many threads
// strangers can make, so a refused thread spends no answer; then every answer against `askAnswers` (400 and 2,000). The store keeps the
// answer, and the first time its thread, in one batch that holds the ask being open (src/store.ts, `answerAsk`). The
// `key` is 32 random bytes as hex that the visitor's browser made once and keeps; only its SHA-256 is kept, so the
// thread is that browser's, and answering again from it adds an answer that shows in place of its last. Every answer
// carries `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`, because an ask is found by its link. Nothing personal is logged.
