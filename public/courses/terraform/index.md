## What Is Terraform?

Terraform is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool that lets you define cloud resources in human-readable configuration files. Instead of clicking through cloud consoles, you write code that describes your infrastructure, and Terraform makes it real.

## Why Infrastructure as Code?

Traditional infrastructure management has problems:

- **Inconsistency** - Manual changes lead to drift between environments
- **No history** - Who changed what, when, and why?
- **Slow recovery** - Rebuilding infrastructure manually is painful
- **Knowledge silos** - Only certain people know how things are set up

IaC solves these by treating infrastructure like software:

- Version controlled
- Peer reviewed
- Reproducible
- Self-documenting

## What You'll Learn

This course covers Terraform fundamentals:

- HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) syntax
- Providers and resources
- Variables and outputs
- State management
- Modules for reusability

## Prerequisites

- Basic command-line skills (see the Unix course if needed)
- An AWS account (free tier works fine)
- Terraform installed locally
- A code editor (VS Code with Terraform extension recommended)

## Course Structure

We'll build real infrastructure as we learn, starting with simple resources and progressing to production-ready patterns.

Let's begin!
