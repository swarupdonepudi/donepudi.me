This morning I made a difficult decision. I put a partnership opportunity on hold—one that could have brought enterprise customers to Planton. The people involved meant well. They wanted to help. But the help was pushing me in a direction that didn't align with how I'm building this company.

When you're a first-time founder and traction is slow, everyone around you has opinions. They see the gap between where you are and where you could be, and they want to close it. Partnership introductions. Sales meetings. Enterprise demos. Move faster. Get in front of customers now.

I'm grateful for the intention. But I've realized something: the people offering to help are thinking outbound sales playbook. I'm building for product-led growth. These are fundamentally different motions with different sequencing requirements.

Product-led growth says: nail the onboarding experience first. Create a clear path to the "aha moment." Let the product convert users without hand-holding. Then drive awareness.

Outbound sales says: get in front of customers now, figure out conversion later.

Both can work. But if you're building PLG and you drive traffic before your onboarding is ready, you burn impressions you can't recover. In B2B, first impressions compound. Buyers talk to each other. A visitor who bounces because they couldn't figure out your product doesn't come back when you've fixed it—they've already moved on.

Planton has the aha moments. Three real companies are using it today and genuinely benefiting. The platform works. But those customers required hand-holding to succeed. I learned what it takes for someone to experience value without talking to me. And that path isn't smooth yet.

So I have a choice: keep getting pulled into partnership logistics, presentation prep, and agreement negotiations—or spend three weeks building the conversion infrastructure that will make every future impression count.

I chose the three weeks.

This isn't hiding behind engineering. Database backups, disaster recovery, a stable production environment, an onboarding flow that guides users to success—these are operational fundamentals. If my GCP organization gets shut down tomorrow, three companies lose their data. If a visitor from LinkedIn hits an empty state with no guidance, that's a lost opportunity I can't undo.

Here's what makes this decision easier: I'm bootstrapped. I put $500K of my own money into this. No VCs. No board. No artificial growth timelines. I'm 37 years old, building something I want my family to own for decades. I'm not in a rush to find traction next week.

I've read the books—Product-Led Growth, Hooked, Obviously Awesome, The Mom Test, The Millionaire Fastlane. Every one of them confirms the approach I'm taking. Sequence matters. Conversion infrastructure before demand generation.

The hardest part of being a founder is trusting your own conviction when well-meaning people are pulling you in a different direction. But at the end of the day, I'm the one doing the work. I'm the one who knows what's actually ready and what isn't. I'm the one who has to live with the consequences of shipping too early or too late.

So I'm taking back control. Three weeks of focused work. Then I go to market on my terms, with a product that converts.

That's the lane I'm choosing.
