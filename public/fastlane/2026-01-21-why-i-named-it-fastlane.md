I'm a huge fan of "The Millionaire Fastlane" by MJ DeMarco. The book shaped how I think about building wealth and living intentionally. It's about choosing the fast lane - not the slow lane of trading time for money, but the lane where you build systems, create value, and accelerate.

That's why I named this space Fastlane. It represents the lane I've chosen for my life.

But here's my own concept that I've been thinking about: life is single-threaded. Every day you wake up, you're on the same lane as yesterday. No branching, no parallel paths. No multithreading. Just you, moving forward, one day at a time. The only variables are your speed and direction.

This space is my personal lane - a continuous stream of thoughts, observations, and moments captured as they happen. Not polished blog posts. Not curated content. Just authentic captures of what's on my mind.

There's no navigation link to this page. If you're reading this, you found it. Welcome to my lane.
