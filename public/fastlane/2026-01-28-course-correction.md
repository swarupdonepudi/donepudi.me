Five days ago I wrote about taking back control. About trusting my conviction when well-meaning people were pulling me in a different direction. About putting a partnership on hold because I needed to focus on product readiness.

Today I reversed that decision.

Here's what happened: the same day I made that call, a meeting took place that I'd agreed to before deciding to pause. A partner I'd been working with had arranged an introduction to a serious enterprise prospect—exactly the kind of company Planton is built for. The meeting went well. Really well. The prospect saw the vision, understood the value, and wanted to move forward.

And in that moment, reflecting on what had just happened, I realized something uncomfortable: I had been taking this partner for granted.

I'd framed their contribution as "introduction-only value" in my head. As if opening doors at serious organizations is easy. As if warm introductions to decision-makers at 300-person companies just materialize out of thin air. As if coordinating meetings, positioning the product correctly, and showing up to support the conversation requires no effort.

It does. It's hard work. And I'd dismissed it.

My conviction about product-led growth had tipped into arrogance about partnership value. I was so focused on operational concerns—agreement terms, product readiness, conversion infrastructure—that I failed to see what was right in front of me: someone working to help Planton succeed, and me treating that help as a distraction.

The meeting was the proof point I needed, but I shouldn't have needed a proof point. I should have given the partnership time to demonstrate value before rushing to judgment. I made a major decision after one week, while stressed about unrelated operational problems. That's not sound judgment. That's reactive decision-making dressed up as conviction.

So I'm reversing course. Not because I was wrong about product readiness—those concerns remain valid and I'm still addressing them. But because I was wrong about the partnership. Wrong about how I valued it. Wrong about how I treated the person behind it.

Here's what I've learned:

Course corrections aren't weakness. They're adaptive leadership. The ability to change direction based on new information—especially information that challenges your ego—is a strength, not a character flaw.

Conviction and arrogance look the same until you examine the humility underneath. Real conviction can hold uncertainty. Arrogance needs to be right.

Opening doors is valuable work. Strategic introductions don't just bring revenue—they bring market validation, positioning feedback, and momentum. That has compounding value beyond any single deal.

And most importantly: taking people for granted damages relationships. Acknowledging contributions builds trust. Humility opens doors; arrogance closes them.

Five days ago I chose a lane. Today I'm choosing a better one—one where I can build great product *and* nurture the partnerships that help it reach the right people.

That's the real lane.
