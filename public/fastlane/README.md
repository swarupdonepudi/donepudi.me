# Fastlane

Life's single-threaded stream.

## What is Fastlane?

Fastlane is a personal timeline - a place to capture day-to-day thoughts, moments, and observations. Unlike polished blog posts, Fastlane entries are quick captures of what's on my mind.

The name comes from "The Millionaire Fastlane" by MJ DeMarco - a book about choosing the fast lane in life, building systems, and accelerating toward your goals. I'm a huge fan, and this space represents the lane I've chosen.

I also think of life as single-threaded - every day you wake up on the same lane as yesterday, no branching, no parallel paths. Just forward motion. This is my personal lane.

## Access

Navigate to `/fastlane` - there's no navigation link. If you're here, you found it.

## Creating Entries

Each entry is a markdown file with minimal frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["optional", "tags"]  # Optional
---

Your content here...
```

### File Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`

Example: `2026-01-21-building-in-public.md`

The date prefix ensures chronological ordering in the filesystem while the slug becomes the URL path.

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | Entry title |
| `date` | Yes | Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `tags` | No | Array of lowercase tags |

**Note:** Unlike blog posts, `excerpt`, `featured_image`, and `author` are not required. Excerpts are auto-generated from content.

## Philosophy

- **Quick to create** - Minimal friction for capturing thoughts
- **Authentic voice** - No need for polish or structure
- **Chronological** - Sorted by date, newest first
- **Discoverable but not advertised** - No navigation link, accessed directly

## Writing for Public Consumption

Fastlane entries are public by design. While I don't actively promote this space, anyone on the internet can read it. This requires thoughtfulness about what goes in and how it's framed.

### What to Keep in Mind

**No naming names.** When writing about professional situations, partnerships, or interpersonal dynamics, never call out specific people or organizations. Use general framing:

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Ruchi was demanding about..." | "A potential partner was pushing for..." |
| "The deal with Yajaman LLC..." | "A partnership opportunity..." |
| "My investor Raghav suggested..." | "Someone close to me suggested..." |

**Avoid grievance or complaint.** Entries can discuss difficult decisions and challenges, but shouldn't read as venting or blame. Frame situations strategically, not emotionally:

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "This person was toxic and wasted my time" | "The partnership wasn't the right fit for this stage" |
| "They didn't understand what I was building" | "We had different views on the right approach" |

**No confidential details.** Don't include:
- Specific agreement terms or financial figures from negotiations
- Internal communications or private conversations
- Details that could identify parties who haven't consented to being public

**Focus on lessons, not situations.** The value of sharing difficult decisions is in the underlying insight - the strategic thinking, the framework for making choices, the personal growth. The specific people and circumstances are just context.

### Why This Matters

- **Relationships persist** - The person you're frustrated with today might be a collaborator tomorrow
- **The internet is permanent** - What you write stays searchable forever
- **Reputation compounds** - How you handle difficult situations publicly reflects on your character
- **Legal exposure** - Naming names in negative contexts creates unnecessary risk

### The Test

Before publishing an entry that involves others, ask:
1. If the person I'm writing about read this, would they feel unfairly represented?
2. Could this create professional or legal complications?
3. Does the entry provide value without the identifying details?

If the entry only works with the names and specifics, it probably belongs in a private journal, not Fastlane.
