# From DevOps Chaos to Platform Engineering

## Overview

This talk explores the evolution from traditional DevOps to modern Platform Engineering, focusing on how to build self-service infrastructure platforms that empower developers without requiring deep infrastructure expertise.

## What You'll Learn

- **The Problem**: Why traditional DevOps doesn't scale for modern engineering teams
- **Platform Engineering Principles**: The shift from tickets to self-service
- **Real-World Architecture**: How we built Planton Cloud's deployment components
- **Multi-Cloud Patterns**: Consistent APIs across AWS, GCP, Azure, and more
- **Developer Experience**: Building abstractions that developers actually want to use

## Key Takeaways

1. **Self-Service Infrastructure**: How to enable developers to provision infrastructure without DevOps team intervention
2. **Consistent Abstractions**: Building unified APIs that work across multiple cloud providers
3. **Production Patterns**: Real infrastructure orchestration challenges and solutions
4. **Open Source Foundation**: Leveraging tools like Pulumi, Helm, and custom frameworks

## For Whom

This talk is designed for:
- Platform engineers building internal developer platforms
- DevOps practitioners looking to scale their impact
- Engineering leaders planning platform initiatives
- Developers who want to understand modern infrastructure patterns

## Technical Level

Intermediate - Assumes basic knowledge of:
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Infrastructure as Code concepts
- Cloud provider fundamentals

## Format

- 30-35 minutes presentation
- 10-15 minutes Q&A
- Live demonstrations of platform concepts
- Interactive discussion encouraged

## Related Work

This talk draws on experiences from:
- Building Planton Cloud (enterprise platform-as-a-service)
- Project Planton (open-source deployment framework)
- Working with diverse teams: IT consulting firms to large product companies
