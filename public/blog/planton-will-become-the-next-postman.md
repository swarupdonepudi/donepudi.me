While working out today, something clicked. Postman and Planton—both have exactly 7 characters. Both start with 'P' and end with 'N'. A pure coincidence, sure, but it felt like a sign.

## Postman: India's First Global Developer Tool

I recently dove deep into Postman's origin story. It's the only developer tool company that truly came out of India and earned global love from the tech community. Founded in 2012 in Bangalore by Abhinav Asthana as a side project at Yahoo, it started as a simple Chrome extension to make API testing less tedious.

The tool caught on fast. With no marketing, it grew to 500,000 users purely by word of mouth. Today, Postman has 30 million users, serves 500,000+ organizations worldwide, and 98% of Fortune 500 companies rely on it. That's not just adoption—that's becoming essential infrastructure for how the world builds software.

## The Belief I'm Declaring Today

I believe—deeply, unshakably—that Planton will become India's second globally loved developer tool.

Conor McGregor once said in a [press conference](http://youtube.com/shorts/LGc-5rlM-WI): "If you truly believe it and if you have the courage to say it, it will happen." I don't know if that's an original quote, and honestly, I don't care. I heard it from Conor, and it resonates with me.

So here it is: **Planton will become the next Postman.**

## Why This Matters

Postman proved that world-class software products can be built from India. When Abhinav Asthana started, there was skepticism—"one cannot build a global product from India," he recalls. But Postman's success destroyed that bias.

I'm building Planton with the same conviction. It's not about where you build; it's about solving real problems for developers worldwide. Postman made API development effortless. Planton will make DevOps effortless. That's the mission.

The coincidence with the names? It's just a fun detail. But the commitment is real.

## The Courage to Say It Out Loud

Declaring something this bold feels vulnerable. What if it doesn't happen? What if people think I'm delusional?

But that's exactly the point. If I don't believe it enough to say it publicly, how will I ever have the conviction to build it? Belief without courage is just a private wish. Belief with courage becomes a commitment.

Postman's founders had to believe they could compete globally from Bangalore. They had to take that leap. Now it's my turn.

Planton will become the next Postman. I believe it. And I'm saying it.
