I woke up at 3 AM today, ready to ramp up my online presence. My plan was simple: jump onto Twitter, post a quick update, and start connecting. But almost before I knew it, 30 minutes vanished while I scrolled through other tweets and followed random threads.

## The Distraction Problem

It reminded me of all the previous times I logged on with the same mission—only to get sidetracked. I realized these platforms are designed to hook me, and I can't just swear them off. Building an online presence has become too crucial to ignore now, so I need a strategy to keep me on track.

## Finding BuildInPublic

That's when I stumbled on a Twitter community called [BuildInPublic](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1618881552080248832). It's made up of people like me, sharing their journeys and building together in public. Instead of casting a wide net across social media, I'm narrowing my focus. I'm going to share my updates and engage strictly within this Build In Public community, tuning out the broader noise on Twitter.

I'm hoping this more intentional approach helps me stay consistent—and actually reach my goal of growing a meaningful online presence.
