# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! I'm Swarup Donepudi, founder of Planton Cloud and creator of Project Planton. This blog is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings from building platform engineering solutions and working with cloud infrastructure.

## What You'll Find Here

### Platform Engineering

I write about the shift from traditional DevOps to modern Platform Engineering - how to build internal developer platforms that enable self-service infrastructure without sacrificing control or security.

### Multi-Cloud Architecture

Real-world patterns and practices for building applications that work across AWS, GCP, Azure, and other cloud providers. I share both the successes and the challenges.

### Developer Experience

How to make infrastructure accessible to developers without requiring deep infrastructure expertise. Building abstractions that developers actually want to use.

### Open Source

Insights from building and maintaining open-source infrastructure tools, including Project Planton and related projects.

## Why I Write

Writing helps me:

1. **Clarify my thinking** - Explaining concepts forces me to understand them deeply
2. **Share learnings** - The mistakes I've made so you don't have to
3. **Build in public** - Documenting the journey of building Planton Cloud
4. **Connect with others** - Finding people working on similar problems

## Topics to Expect

- Platform engineering patterns and anti-patterns
- Kubernetes deployment strategies
- Infrastructure as Code best practices
- Multi-cloud considerations and tradeoffs
- Developer tooling and CLI design
- Technical leadership and team building
- Lessons from startup infrastructure

## Stay in Touch

I'm always interested in hearing from people working on similar problems or exploring new approaches to infrastructure challenges.

- **Twitter/X**: Follow for quick updates and thoughts
- **LinkedIn**: Professional updates and longer articles
- **GitHub**: Open source code and contributions
- **Email**: swarup@planton.cloud - I read and respond to everything

## What's Next

I'm working on posts about:

- The architecture of Planton Cloud
- Building deployment orchestration at scale
- How we designed our deployment component system
- Lessons from supporting 500+ infrastructure components

Subscribe or check back regularly for new posts. I aim to publish at least once a week with substantive technical content.

Thanks for reading!

Swarup
