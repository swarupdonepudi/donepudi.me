I never imagined being laid off would turn into a gift. When my company [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/), in San Francisco let me go in 2022, I received a decent severance that freed me from the usual nine-to-five grind. Suddenly, I didn't have to wake up and worry about deadlines or team updates. It was the first time I could decide exactly how I spent my day, and I felt this rare rush of creative energy.

## The Side Projects I'd Been Dreaming About

I poured myself into side projects that I'd only been dabbling in before. No corporate meetings, no waiting for approvals—just me and the work that excited me. Rather than feeling stressed about losing a job, I discovered a sense of possibility that a regular paycheck never gave me. It was like hitting a reset button on my life.

## From Layoff to Launch

Next, I channeled that newfound freedom into starting what eventually became PlantonCloud. It's a product I'm building from scratch, fueled by the excitement and confidence I found during that unplanned break. Maybe the layoff wasn't just an ending—it was the spark for my biggest chapter yet.
