June was about discipline, resilience, and clarity. It began with me recommitting to my cherished routine of waking up at 3 AM. While some see this as extreme, for me, these early morning hours are a sanctuary of productivity. After a shaky start—fighting off lethargy and distraction—I eventually locked into a rhythm that profoundly amplified my output.

## Technical Transformation: Monorepo, NATS, and Bazel

I spent most of June deep in refactoring and migrating critical parts of my product, PlantonCloud. Moving from Kafka to [NATS](https://nats.io/), consolidating services into a streamlined monorepo, and harnessing the power of [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) with remote build execution via [BuildBuddy](https://www.buildbuddy.io/) transformed the way I build and deploy. What once took minutes now completes in seconds. Every commit triggers clear feedback and powerful visual workflows, giving me a newfound confidence in the stability and potential of what I'm creating.

## Blocking Distractions to Reclaim Focus

But not every moment was smooth. Mid-month, I struggled with self-doubt, amplified by distractions—particularly YouTube. Rather than rely on pure willpower, I blocked it entirely from my devices, a decision that quickly paid off. Within days, that regained focus turned into meaningful progress and clarity.

## The Financial Reality: Product to Business

This month also offered an important reminder about financial discipline. Receiving some much-needed support bought valuable runway, but also underscored the urgency of turning my product into sustainable revenue. This realization sharpened my focus further. It became clear that building a great product is only half the story—transforming it into a profitable business is the true challenge ahead.

## Validation from CoreStack

One notable interaction stood out: a chance meeting with the product lead of a growing startup, CoreStack. My demo wasn't perfect, but his genuine interest validated the strength of our UX, reminding me how close I am to the critical step of real customer engagement.

## The Power of Simplicity

Reflecting on the complexity of the product, I recognized the power of simplicity. Two key infrastructure management concepts, previously separate, merged beautifully into a unified solution. Simplifying the product not only reduced confusion but also reinforced a critical insight: great user experiences come from clarity, not complexity.

## Family and Balance

Toward the month's end, family milestones and personal moments added balance to the intense workload. Celebrating our 7th wedding anniversary was a meaningful pause, reminding me why all this effort matters. Those moments helped me step back, regain perspective, and recharge for what's next.

## Looking Ahead

Heading into July, I'm more ready than ever. June clarified my priorities, sharpened my discipline, and reminded me that progress—real progress—comes from relentlessly simplifying, removing distractions, and staying focused on the things that truly matter.
