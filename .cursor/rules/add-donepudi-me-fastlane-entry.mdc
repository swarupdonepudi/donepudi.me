# Rule: Add Fastlane Entry

**Purpose**: Quickly capture thoughts, observations, and moments to the Fastlane personal timeline with minimal friction.

**Type**: Action rule

**When to use**: User says "fastlane:", "add to fastlane", "fastlane entry", or provides content they want to add to their timeline.

---

## Philosophy

Fastlane is for capturing life's moments without the overhead of polished blog posts. Speed matters. Authenticity matters. Don't over-structure or over-polish - preserve the raw voice.

---

## Inputs User Will Provide

The user will provide one or more of:

1. **Title**: Explicitly stated or extractable from content
2. **Content**: Raw thoughts, observations, or reflections
3. **Tags**: Optionally mentioned or inferable from context

**Examples of triggers:**
- "fastlane: Just realized that consistency beats intensity"
- "add to fastlane - thoughts on building in public"
- "fastlane entry about today's breakthrough"

---

## What You Must Do

### 1. Extract or Generate Title

If title is explicit, use it. Otherwise, extract from the first sentence or generate a concise title that captures the essence.

**Good titles:**
- Short, punchy (under 10 words)
- Captures the core thought
- Doesn't need to be clever or catchy

### 2. Get Today's Date

Use the current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### 3. Generate Slug

Create URL-friendly slug from title:
- Convert to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters except hyphens
- Keep it concise

**Example:** "Why I Read at 5 AM" → `why-i-read-at-5-am`

### 4. Suggest Tags (Optional)

If the content naturally fits certain themes, suggest 1-3 tags:

| Theme | Suggested Tags |
|-------|---------------|
| Personal growth | `reflection`, `personal`, `growth` |
| Planton/work | `planton`, `startup`, `work` |
| Productivity | `productivity`, `discipline`, `habits` |
| Reading/learning | `reading`, `learning`, `books` |
| Technical | `engineering`, `code`, `infrastructure` |
| Life observations | `life`, `observation`, `wisdom` |

Tags are optional - don't force them if the content doesn't fit neatly.

### 5. Create the File

**Location:** `donepudi.me/public/fastlane/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`

**Structure:**
```yaml
---
title: "The Title Here"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]  # Optional, omit if none
---

Content here...

Preserve the user's voice exactly. Don't restructure, don't add headings unless the content naturally needs them.
```

### 6. Preserve Authentic Voice

**DO:**
- Keep the original phrasing
- Preserve paragraph breaks
- Fix obvious typos only
- Add markdown links for URLs if present

**DON'T:**
- Restructure the content
- Add headers where there were none
- Change the tone or voice
- Add commentary or conclusions
- Over-polish casual thoughts

### 7. Ensure Public-Safe Content

Fastlane is public. Anyone on the internet can read it. When the user shares content involving professional situations, partnerships, or interpersonal dynamics, ensure the entry is safe for public consumption.

**Remove or generalize identifying details:**

| User says | You write |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Ruchi was demanding about the agreement" | "A potential partner was pushing for faster timelines" |
| "The deal with Yajaman LLC fell through" | "A partnership opportunity didn't work out" |
| "My investor Raghav suggested I move faster" | "Someone close to me suggested I move faster" |
| "The meeting with MISO executives" | "A meeting with enterprise prospects" |

**Reframe grievance as insight:**

| User says | You write |
|-----------|-----------|
| "This person was toxic and wasted my time" | "The partnership wasn't the right fit for this stage" |
| "They didn't understand what I was building" | "We had different views on the right approach" |
| "He was being unreasonable about timelines" | "There was pressure to move faster than I was comfortable with" |

**Never include:**
- Names of people, companies, or organizations in negative contexts
- Specific agreement terms, financial figures, or negotiation details
- Private communications or confidential business information
- Details that could identify parties who haven't consented

**The test before finalizing:**
1. If the person being discussed read this, would they feel unfairly represented?
2. Could this create professional or legal complications?
3. Does the entry provide value without the identifying details?

If the content only works with names and specifics, suggest to the user that it might belong in a private journal rather than Fastlane.

## File Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`

**Examples:**
- `2026-01-21-why-consistency-beats-intensity.md`
- `2026-01-21-building-in-public.md`
- `2026-01-21-5am-reading-habit.md`

---

## Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
title: "Required - the entry title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["optional", "array", "of", "tags"]
---
```

**Required fields:**
- `title` - Entry title
- `date` - Publication date

**Optional fields:**
- `tags` - Array of lowercase tags

**NOT needed (unlike blog):**
- `excerpt` - Auto-generated from content
- `featured_image` - Not used in Fastlane
- `author` - Always Swarup

---

## Example Workflow

**User says:**
> fastlane: Just had a realization while reading The Millionaire Fastlane again. Life really is single-threaded. Every day you wake up, you're on the same lane as yesterday. No branching, no parallel paths. The only variable is your speed and direction. That's why I named this feature Fastlane.

**You create:** `donepudi.me/public/fastlane/2026-01-21-life-is-single-threaded.md`

```yaml
---
title: "Life is Single-Threaded"
date: "2026-01-21"
tags: ["reflection", "reading"]
---

## Notes

- **Location:** `donepudi.me/public/fastlane/`
- **Access:** `/fastlane` (no navigation link - discovered only by URL)
- **Purpose:** Quick captures, not polished posts
- **Speed:** This should take seconds, not minutes
- **Visibility:** Public to the internet - anyone can read it

**Remember:** The goal is minimal friction. Get the thought captured quickly and authentically. Polish is for blog posts.

**Public-safe reminder:** Fastlane is public. When content involves other people or professional situations, generalize identifying details and reframe grievances as insights. The internet is permanent, relationships persist, and reputation compounds.
