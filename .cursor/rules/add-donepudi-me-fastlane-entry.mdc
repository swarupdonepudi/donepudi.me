# Rule: Add Fastlane Entry

**Purpose**: Quickly capture thoughts, observations, and moments to the Fastlane personal timeline with minimal friction.

**Type**: Action rule

**When to use**: User says "fastlane:", "add to fastlane", "fastlane entry", or provides content they want to add to their timeline.

---

## Philosophy

Fastlane is for capturing life's moments without the overhead of polished blog posts. Speed matters. Authenticity matters. Don't over-structure or over-polish - preserve the raw voice.

---

## Inputs User Will Provide

The user will provide one or more of:

1. **Title**: Explicitly stated or extractable from content
2. **Content**: Raw thoughts, observations, or reflections
3. **Tags**: Optionally mentioned or inferable from context

**Examples of triggers:**
- "fastlane: Just realized that consistency beats intensity"
- "add to fastlane - thoughts on building in public"
- "fastlane entry about today's breakthrough"

---

## What You Must Do

### 1. Extract or Generate Title

If title is explicit, use it. Otherwise, extract from the first sentence or generate a concise title that captures the essence.

**Good titles:**
- Short, punchy (under 10 words)
- Captures the core thought
- Doesn't need to be clever or catchy

### 2. Get Today's Date

Use the current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### 3. Generate Slug

Create URL-friendly slug from title:
- Convert to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters except hyphens
- Keep it concise

**Example:** "Why I Read at 5 AM" → `why-i-read-at-5-am`

### 4. Suggest Tags (Optional)

If the content naturally fits certain themes, suggest 1-3 tags:

| Theme | Suggested Tags |
|-------|---------------|
| Personal growth | `reflection`, `personal`, `growth` |
| Planton/work | `planton`, `startup`, `work` |
| Productivity | `productivity`, `discipline`, `habits` |
| Reading/learning | `reading`, `learning`, `books` |
| Technical | `engineering`, `code`, `infrastructure` |
| Life observations | `life`, `observation`, `wisdom` |

Tags are optional - don't force them if the content doesn't fit neatly.

### 5. Create the File

**Location:** `donepudi.me/public/fastlane/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`

**Structure:**
```yaml
---
title: "The Title Here"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]  # Optional, omit if none
---

Content here...

Preserve the user's voice exactly. Don't restructure, don't add headings unless the content naturally needs them.
```

### 6. Preserve Authentic Voice

**DO:**
- Keep the original phrasing
- Preserve paragraph breaks
- Fix obvious typos only
- Add markdown links for URLs if present

**DON'T:**
- Restructure the content
- Add headers where there were none
- Change the tone or voice
- Add commentary or conclusions
- Over-polish casual thoughts

---

## File Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`

**Examples:**
- `2026-01-21-why-consistency-beats-intensity.md`
- `2026-01-21-building-in-public.md`
- `2026-01-21-5am-reading-habit.md`

---

## Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
title: "Required - the entry title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["optional", "array", "of", "tags"]
---
```

**Required fields:**
- `title` - Entry title
- `date` - Publication date

**Optional fields:**
- `tags` - Array of lowercase tags

**NOT needed (unlike blog):**
- `excerpt` - Auto-generated from content
- `featured_image` - Not used in Fastlane
- `author` - Always Swarup

---

## Example Workflow

**User says:**
> fastlane: Just had a realization while reading The Millionaire Fastlane again. Life really is single-threaded. Every day you wake up, you're on the same lane as yesterday. No branching, no parallel paths. The only variable is your speed and direction. That's why I named this feature Fastlane.

**You create:** `donepudi.me/public/fastlane/2026-01-21-life-is-single-threaded.md`

```yaml
---
title: "Life is Single-Threaded"
date: "2026-01-21"
tags: ["reflection", "reading"]
---

## Notes

- **Location:** `donepudi.me/public/fastlane/`
- **Access:** `/fastlane` (no navigation link - discovered only by URL)
- **Purpose:** Quick captures, not polished posts
- **Speed:** This should take seconds, not minutes

**Remember:** The goal is minimal friction. Get the thought captured quickly and authentically. Polish is for blog posts.
