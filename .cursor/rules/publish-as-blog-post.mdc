# Rule: Publish as Blog Post

**Purpose**: Transform raw journal entries or conversation insights into polished, publication-ready blog posts with proper structure, frontmatter, and image handling.

**Type**: Action rule

**When to use**: User will invoke this rule (e.g., `@publish-as-blog-post`) and provide context from journal entries or conversations they want to convert into a blog post.

---

## Two Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Journal Entry to Blog Post

User provides:
- Journal entry text (from `jad/journal/` repository)
- What specific insight or story they want to highlight

Agent extracts and transforms the relevant portion into a reader-friendly narrative.

**Example**: Converting a journal reflection about Postman and Planton having the same character count into a blog post.

### Scenario 2: Conversation/Technical Discovery to Blog Post

User provides:
- Conversation history or technical insight
- Optional: specific angle or takeaway

Agent distills the key insight into an accessible narrative with problem → solution → impact structure.

**Example**: Converting a technical discovery from a cursor AI conversation into a blog post about the learning.

---

## What You Must Do

### 1. Analyze Context

**Read and understand** the provided content:
- If journal entry: identify the core insight, story, or realization
- If conversation: distill the key technical or conceptual breakthrough
- Determine what aspect resonates as shareable knowledge

**Extract the essence**:
- What's the main point or story?
- Why would readers care?
- What's the hook or interesting angle?

### 2. Generate Title

Create a compelling, descriptive title:
- Captures the essence of the insight
- Hooks the reader's curiosity
- Natural and conversational (not clickbait)
- 5-12 words typically

**Examples**:
- "Postman and Planton: A Curious Coincidence"
- "Why Consulting Often Leads to Product Ideas"
- "The YouTube Knowledge Trap We Tell Ourselves"

### 3. Create Slug

Generate URL-friendly slug from title and prepend with date:
- Convert title to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters except hyphens
- Keep it descriptive and readable
- Prepend with date in YYYY-MM-DD format from frontmatter
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}`

**Examples**:
- "Postman and Planton: A Curious Coincidence" (dated 2025-11-25) → `2025-11-25-postman-planton-curious-coincidence`
- "Why I Built Planton After 10 Years" (dated 2025-11-26) → `2025-11-26-why-i-built-planton-after-10-years`

### 4. Write Blog Post Content

**Transform the content** following these guidelines:

#### Opening Hook (First Paragraph)
- Start with relatable context or observation
- Draw reader in with a story or question
- Set up what the post is about
- Keep it conversational and authentic

#### Section Structure
- Use `## H2` headings for major sections (typically 2-5 sections)
- Headings should be descriptive and natural
- Examples: `## Why This Matters`, `## The Realization`, `## Real-World Examples`, `## Looking Ahead`

#### Voice and Tone
- **Conversational**: First-person, like talking to a friend
- **Authentic**: Keep your personality and style
- **Clear**: Polish for readability without losing voice
- **Relatable**: Include personal experiences, real examples

#### Content Guidelines
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-4 sentences typically
- **Natural flow**: Logical progression of ideas
- **Real examples**: Name products, companies, specific situations
- **Personal touch**: Include "I" experiences and observations
- **No fluff**: Get to the point, no marketing speak

#### Closing
- Brief reflection or forward-looking thought
- Can be a single sentence or short paragraph
- Leave reader with something to think about

### 5. Create Frontmatter

Generate complete YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Exact Title You Generated"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # Use today's date unless user specifies otherwise
excerpt: "One or two sentence summary that entices readers (under 200 characters)"
featured_image: "/blog/images/{date-slug}.cover.png"
author: "Swarup Donepudi"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4", "tag5"]
---
```

**Excerpt Guidelines**:
- First 1-2 sentences from content, OR
- Generate compelling summary that hooks readers
- Under 200 characters
- Should make readers want to click and read more

**Tag Guidelines** (3-5 tags):
- Automatically generate based on content themes
- Use lowercase
- Mix of technical, business, and personal as relevant

**Common Tags**:
- Technical: `cloud`, `infrastructure`, `ai`, `productivity`, `tools`, `development`, `devops`
- Business: `consulting`, `product`, `startup`, `entrepreneurship`, `planton-cloud`, `platform`
- Personal: `reflection`, `discipline`, `personal`, `focus`, `journey`
- Specific: `datacenter`, `37signals`, `kamal`, `chatgpt`, `postman`, `kubernetes`

### 6. Handle Images

#### Placeholder Cover Image (Always)

**Always copy the placeholder cover**:
```bash
# From: donepudi.me/public/blog/images/_blog_placeholder.cover.png
# To:   donepudi.me/public/blog/images/{date-slug}.cover.png
```

This placeholder will be replaced by user with a Gemini-generated cover image.

#### Additional Images (From Workspace)

**If images exist in workspace folder** (`donepudi.me/public/blog/images/workspace/`):

1. **Check for images**:
   - List all image files in `donepudi.me/public/blog/images/workspace/`
   - If no images found, skip this step
   - If images found, proceed with steps below

2. **Review each image**:
   - Examine the image content (if possible) or use filename as context
   - Determine where in the blog post this image should be embedded
   - Identify the most appropriate section/paragraph

3. **Generate brief descriptor**:
   - Create a short, descriptive name for the image (2-3 words max)
   - Examples: `screenshot`, `diagram`, `example`, `comparison`, `result`, `architecture`
   - Keep it simple and relevant to the image content

4. **Copy and rename image**:
   ```bash
   # From: donepudi.me/public/blog/images/workspace/image1.png
   # To:   donepudi.me/public/blog/images/{date-slug}-{descriptor}.png
   # Example: 2025-11-25-postman-planton-curious-coincidence-screenshot.png
   ```

5. **Embed in markdown**:
   - Insert at the appropriate location in the blog post
   - Use descriptive alt text
   ```markdown
   ![Descriptive alt text explaining what the image shows](/blog/images/{date-slug}-{descriptor}.png)
   ```

6. **Delete from workspace**:
   - After successfully copying and embedding, delete the original image from workspace folder
   - This keeps the workspace clean for the next blog post

**Important Notes**:
- Preserve file extensions (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, etc.)
- Use the same slug as the blog post filename
- Embed images at logical breakpoints (between paragraphs or sections)
- Clean up workspace after processing all images

### 7. Create Markdown File

Write the complete blog post to:
```
donepudi.me/public/blog/{date-slug}.md
```

**File structure**:
```markdown
---
[frontmatter as above]
---

[Opening paragraph - the hook]

## Section Heading 1

[Content...]

## Section Heading 2

[Content...]

![Image alt text](/blog/images/{date-slug}-image.png)

## Section Heading 3

[Content...]

[Closing paragraph]
```

### 8. Inform User

After creating the blog post, tell the user:

```
✅ Blog post created: `donepudi.me/public/blog/{date-slug}.md`
✅ Placeholder cover copied: `donepudi.me/public/blog/images/{date-slug}.cover.png`
[If images were processed from workspace:]
✅ {N} image(s) embedded: [{list of image filenames}]
✅ Workspace cleaned (images removed after processing)

**Next steps**:
1. Generate cover image using Gemini Nano Banana
   - Use the title: "{title}"
   - Provide the content for context
2. Replace the placeholder cover image
3. Run `make build` to verify (optional)
4. Commit and push to publish

**Title for Gemini**: {title}
**Post preview**: [First paragraph of the post]
```

**Note**: If images were found in workspace and processed, mention:
- Number of images embedded
- List of final image filenames (e.g., `{date-slug}-screenshot.png`, `{date-slug}-diagram.png`)
- Confirmation that workspace was cleaned

## Content Transformation Examples

### Example 1: Journal Entry → Blog Post

**Input** (from journal):
> "While I was working out today, I realized that both Postman and Planton have same number of characters and also start and end with the same letter. That is a legit coincidence."

**Output** (blog post opening):
> I've been thinking a lot about Postman lately. It's the only developer tool company that truly came out of India and earned global love from the tech community. I'm determined to make Planton the second one.
> 
> ## A Curious Coincidence
> 
> Today during my workout, something clicked: both Postman and Planton have exactly 7 characters. They both start with 'P' and end with 'N'. Pure coincidence, but it feels like a good omen.

### Example 2: Conversation → Blog Post

**Input** (technical discovery):
> "I just realized our current system doesn't support target-cluster references in kubernetes-components anymore. But there's more standardization now for kubernetes-based components."

**Output** (blog post structure):
> When you're deep in building a platform, sometimes the best insights come from recognizing what you can remove, not what you can add.
> 
> ## The Abstraction Trap
> 
> For the longest time, our system tried to abstract away Kubernetes namespaces. We thought we were helping users by handling namespace creation automatically. [...]
> 
> ## The Shift to Simplicity
> 
> Today I realized we don't need target-cluster references anymore. [...]

**Philosophy**: Blog posts should feel like conversations with a fellow developer or founder. They share real insights, personal experiences, and practical wisdom. The goal is to be authentic and helpful, not promotional or overly polished. Write the way you'd explain something to a friend over coffee.

**Status**: Ready to use

**Usage**: User invokes `@publish-as-blog-post` with journal entry or conversation context, and you follow this workflow to create a publication-ready blog post.
