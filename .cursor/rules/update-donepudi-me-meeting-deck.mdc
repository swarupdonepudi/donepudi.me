# Rule: Update donepudi.me Meeting Deck

Purpose: Make iterative updates to an existing meeting presentation deck based on feedback. Use this when you have an existing deck that needs content changes, slide additions, or refinements.

Usage: Invoke as `@update-donepudi-me-meeting-deck` with the guest slug and requested changes.

## Overview

This rule provides a streamlined workflow for updating existing meeting decks. Unlike the create rule, this focuses on iterative refinement with live preview support.

**Key Principle:** The dev server should already be running during updates. Do not run build commands until all updates are finalized and approved.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this rule, ensure:
1. The deck already exists at `src/components/meetings/guests/[guest-slug]/`
2. The dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
3. You have the guest slug and specific changes requested

---

## Phase 1: Understand the Request

When triggered, I will:

1. **Identify the guest** from your message
2. **Read the existing deck** to understand current structure
3. **Clarify the changes** if needed

### Information I Need

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Guest Slug | Existing deck identifier | `acme`, `example` |
| Changes | What needs to be modified | "Update slide 3 stats", "Add new closing slide" |
| Context | Why the change is needed (optional) | "Meeting moved to in-person" |

### Quick Confirmation

```markdown
## Deck Update: [Guest Slug]

**Current Deck:**
- Slides: [N slides]
- Location: src/components/meetings/guests/[slug]/

**Requested Changes:**
1. [Change 1]
2. [Change 2]

**Questions (if any):**
- [Clarification needed]

Shall I proceed with these changes?
```

---

## Phase 2: Make Updates

### Types of Updates

**Content Changes:**
- Update text, numbers, or data
- Fix typos or improve wording
- Change presenter notes

**Structural Changes:**
- Add new slides
- Remove slides
- Reorder slides

**Style Changes:**
- Change slide variants
- Update component usage
- Modify layouts

### File Locations

```
src/components/meetings/guests/[guest-slug]/
├── config.ts           # Slide array, metadata, presenter notes
└── slides/
    ├── S01Cover.tsx    # Individual slide components
    ├── S02[Topic].tsx
    └── ...
```

### Common Update Patterns

**Update presenter notes:**
```tsx
// In config.ts, find the slide and update presenterNotes array
{
  id: 'slide-id',
  name: 'Slide Name',
  component: S01Cover,
  presenterNotes: [
    'Updated note 1',
    'New note 2',
    '<strong>Emphasis</strong> on key point',
  ],
},
```

**Add a new slide:**
1. Create new file: `slides/S0N[Name].tsx`
2. Add import to `config.ts`
3. Add entry to slides array in correct position
4. Update subsequent slide numbers if needed

**Update slide content:**
Edit the specific slide component file directly.

**Change meeting metadata:**
Update the config object in `config.ts`:
```tsx
export const [guestSlug]Config: GuestConfig = {
  slides: [guestSlug]Slides,
  guest: '[guest-slug]',
  meetingDate: 'yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm',  // Update if meeting time changed
  presenter: 'Swarup Donepudi',
  context: '[Updated context]',
  location: '[New location]',
};
```

## Phase 3: Live Preview

### During Updates

With dev server running, changes are reflected immediately:
1. Save the file
2. Browser auto-refreshes
3. Review the change
4. Provide feedback or approve

### Review Checklist

For each change:
- [ ] Content displays correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works (resize browser)
- [ ] Presenter notes updated if content changed
- [ ] Slide transitions smooth
- [ ] No console errors

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| → / Space | Next slide |
| ← | Previous slide |
| N | Toggle presenter notes |
| F | Toggle fullscreen |
| H / Home | First slide |

---

## Phase 4: Finalize

Once all changes are approved:

### Stop Dev Server

If needed for build verification (Ctrl+C in terminal).

### Run Build

```bash
cd /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/swarupdonepudi/donepudi.me
npm run build
```

### Verify

- Build completes without errors
- All routes still work
- Changes persist in production build

---

## Phase 5: Changelog

**Status:** ✅ Live
**URL:** https://donepudi.me/meets/[guest-slug]
```

---

## Session Tracking

During an update session, I will track:

1. **Files modified** - List of changed files
2. **Changes made** - Summary of each change
3. **Review status** - What's been approved
4. **Pending items** - What still needs work

This ensures nothing is missed when generating the changelog.

---

## Quick Reference

### Start Update Session

```bash
# Ensure dev server is running
cd /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/swarupdonepudi/donepudi.me
npm run dev

# Open deck in browser
open http://localhost:3000/meets/[guest-slug]
```

### Finalize Session

```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Run build
npm run build

# Verify
npm run start
# Check http://localhost:3000/meets/[guest-slug]
```

## Common Update Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Update Stats

"Update the stats on slide 4 with new numbers"

1. Open `slides/S04Stats.tsx`
2. Update the numbers in the component
3. Save and verify in browser
4. Update presenter notes if needed

### Scenario 2: Add New Slide

"Add a slide about our team between slides 3 and 4"

1. Create `slides/S04Team.tsx` (new slide)
2. Rename `S04Stats.tsx` → `S05Stats.tsx` (and update exports)
3. Update `config.ts` imports and slides array
4. Save and verify order in browser

### Scenario 3: Change Meeting Details

"Meeting moved from Zoom to in-person at their office"

1. Update `config.ts`:
   ```tsx
   location: 'Client Office, San Francisco',
   ```
2. Update cover slide if it displays location
3. Save and verify

### Scenario 4: Improve Flow

"The solution slide comes too early, move it after the demo"

1. Reorder entries in the slides array in `config.ts`
2. Optionally rename files if numbering matters
3. Save and verify navigation

---

## Important Notes

1. **Don't run build during iteration** - Use dev server for instant feedback
2. **Small, incremental changes** - Easier to review and approve
3. **Always verify responsive** - Resize browser to check mobile view
4. **Update presenter notes** - Keep them in sync with content changes
5. **Track all changes** - For accurate changelog generation

---

## Summary

This rule enables efficient iterative updates to existing meeting decks:

1. **Understand** - Clarify what needs to change
2. **Update** - Make changes to the appropriate files
3. **Preview** - Review with live dev server
4. **Finalize** - Build and verify
5. **Document** - Generate changelog entry

The goal is rapid iteration with immediate feedback, only running build when changes are finalized and approved.
