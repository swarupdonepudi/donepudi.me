# Rule: Iterate Until Build Succeeds

## When This Applies

After making ANY code changes (edits, new files, deletions), you MUST:

1. Run `make build` (or equivalent build command)
2. If build fails, read the error
3. Fix the error
4. Run `make build` again
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until build succeeds

## Critical Points

- **DO NOT** stop after making changes without verifying the build
- **DO NOT** ask the user if you should fix build errors - just fix them
- **DO NOT** assume the build works - always verify
- If build cache issues occur, run `rm -rf .next out && make build`
- Keep iterating until you see `✓ Compiled successfully` and `✓ Generating static pages`

## Expected Behavior

```bash
# After any code change:
make build

# If errors appear, fix them and run again:
make build

# Repeat until you see:
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages (10/10)
```

Only after seeing successful build output should you commit or report completion.

## Do NOT

- ❌ Stop after editing files without building
- ❌ Ask "should I run the build?" - YES, always
- ❌ Report "changes made" without verifying build succeeds
- ❌ Assume changes work without testing

## DO

- ✅ Run `make build` after every change
- ✅ Fix errors immediately when they appear
- ✅ Clean cache if needed (`rm -rf .next out`)
- ✅ Iterate until success
- ✅ Only then commit or report completion
