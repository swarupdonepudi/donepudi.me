---

## Inputs User Will Provide

When this rule is triggered, the user will provide:

1. **Title**: Either directly stated or visible in a screenshot
2. **Date**: Either directly stated or visible in a screenshot (format: "March 18, 2025" or "April 1, 2025")
3. **Content**: In a placeholder markdown file like `donepudi.me/public/blog/a.md` or `donepudi.me/public/blog/b.md`
4. **Cover Image**: In `donepudi.me/public/blog/images/` with a random name like `image.png`, `realization.png`, etc.
5. **Optional**: Screenshot showing title and date from the published Hey World post
6. **Optional**: Links or references to embed in the content

---

## What You Must Do

### 1. Extract Information

- Read the title (from user message or screenshot)
- Extract the date (from user message or screenshot)
- Read the content from the placeholder markdown file
- Note the cover image filename

### 2. Generate Slug

Create a URL-friendly slug from the title:
- Convert to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters except hyphens
- Example: "Time to Shift Your Mindset" → `ai-efficiency-mindset`

### 3. Create Frontmatter

Add complete YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Exact Title From User"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # Convert "March 18, 2025" to "2025-03-18"
excerpt: "First 1-2 sentences from content, or generate compelling summary"
featured_image: "/blog/images/{slug}.cover.png"
author: "Swarup Donepudi"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]  # Generate 3-5 relevant tags
---
```

**Tag Guidelines**:
- Use lowercase
- Common tags: `cloud`, `datacenter`, `infrastructure`, `ai`, `productivity`, `startup`, `consulting`, `planton-cloud`, `reflection`, `personal`, `development`, `efficiency`, `tools`
- Choose tags that match the content topic

### 4. Format Content

**Structure with headings**:
- Add `## H2` headings to break up sections
- Headings should be descriptive and natural
- Don't force headings where they don't fit
- Typical structure: Intro paragraph(s) → Section 1 → Section 2 → Closing

**Enhance readability**:
- Convert plain URLs to markdown links with descriptive text
- Preserve **bold** emphasis where it exists
- Fix minor typos if obvious
- Add line breaks between paragraphs if missing

**What NOT to do**:
- ❌ Don't rewrite the author's voice
- ❌ Don't add marketing fluff or buzzwords
- ❌ Don't change the tone or personality
- ❌ Don't add content that wasn't there
- ❌ Don't over-structure simple posts
- ✅ Keep it natural and authentic

### 5. Rename Files

**Rename markdown file**:
```bash
# From: donepudi.me/public/blog/a.md
# To:   donepudi.me/public/blog/{slug}.md
```

**Rename cover image**:
```bash
# From: donepudi.me/public/blog/images/image.png
# To:   donepudi.me/public/blog/images/{slug}.cover.png
```

Use the same slug for both files.

### 6. Clean Up

Delete the placeholder markdown file after creating the final version.

## Example Workflow

**User provides**:
- Title: "A Practical Way to Spark Your Next Product Idea: Start with Consulting"
- Date: March 19, 2025
- Content: `donepudi.me/public/blog/a.md`
- Cover: `donepudi.me/public/blog/images/image.png`

**You do**:
1. Generate slug: `consulting-to-product-ideas`
2. Rename image: `image.png` → `consulting-to-product-ideas.cover.png`
3. Create `consulting-to-product-ideas.md` with:
   - Frontmatter (title, date: "2025-03-19", excerpt, featured_image, author, tags)
   - Formatted content with `## H2` headings
   - Hyperlinked URLs
4. Delete `a.md`

---

## Naming Convention

**Markdown files**: `{slug}.md`
- kebab-case
- descriptive of content
- Examples: `37-signals-in-datacenter.md`, `consulting-to-product-ideas.md`, `ai-efficiency-mindset.md`

**Cover images**: `{slug}.cover.png`
- Must match the markdown slug
- `.cover.png` suffix indicates it's a cover/hero image
- Examples: `37-signals-in-datacenter.cover.png`, `consulting-to-product-ideas.cover.png`

**Inline images** (if any): `{slug}.png` or `{slug}-{descriptor}.png`
- No `.cover` suffix
- Used for images embedded in content
