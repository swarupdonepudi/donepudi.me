# Rule: Pull Request Title and Description (ask-only)

Purpose: When asked to write a PR title and PR description, respond with exactly two copyable code blocks — first the title, then the description — without making any repository changes.

This rule is designed for ask mode only. Do not modify files, run commands, or propose edits. Output only the two fenced code blocks described below.

Usage: In Ask mode, invoke explicitly as `@generate-donepudi-me-pr-info`.

## How to respond (strict)
1) First block: PR Title
   - Fenced code block with language: `text`
   - Single line only
   - Prefix using Conventional Commits: one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `chore`, `revert`
   - Scope is required and must be repository-aware, using a token derived from changed files (see heuristics)
   - Imperative mood, concise, ≤ 72 characters after the prefix
   - No trailing period

2) Second block: PR Description
   - Fenced code block with language: `markdown`
   - Use the following sections when applicable. Omit any that are not relevant.
     - "Summary": 1–3 sentences describing what this PR does in plain language
     - "Context": Why this change is needed (problem, goal, or motivation)
     - "Changes": Bullet list of key changes; group by area if helpful
     - "Implementation notes": Important design decisions or trade-offs
     - "Visual changes": Screenshots or descriptions of UI/UX updates
     - "Breaking changes": Clearly call out any breaking behavior and migration steps
     - "Test plan": How this was verified (manual testing, browser checks)
     - "Performance impact": Bundle size, load time, or other metrics
     - "Checklist": Markdown checkboxes for docs, tests, accessibility
     - Optionally include issue links like `Closes #123` when known

## Title format (exactly)

```text
<prefix>(<scope>): <concise, imperative title>
```

### Examples of valid scopes (donepudi.me)
- `blog`
- `talks`
- `portfolio`
- `ui`
- `layout`
- `api`
- `lib`
- `hooks`
- `styles`
- `config`
- `deps`
- `build`
- `repo`

## How to infer the title prefix
- `feat`: Adds new feature, section, component, or content system
- `fix`: Corrects a bug or issue
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing visible behavior
- `docs`: Documentation-only changes (README, content docs)
- `style`: UI/UX styling changes (CSS, design updates, visual improvements)
- `perf`: Performance improvements (bundle size, load times, optimizations)
- `ci`: CI/CD pipeline changes
- `build`: Build system or deployment changes
- `chore`: Routine maintenance (formatting, dependency updates)
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit/PR

## Repository-aware scope heuristics (donepudi.me)
Determine the `<scope>` from the changed files. Use the most impacted area by lines changed; if multiple, see multi-area guidance.

- Content
  - `public/blog/**` or `src/app/blog/**` → `blog`
  - `public/talks/**` or `src/app/talks/**` → `talks`
  - `src/components/portfolio/**` → `portfolio`

- UI & Components
  - `src/components/ui/**` → `ui`
  - `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/components/Layout.jsx` → `layout`

- Technical
  - `src/api/**` → `api`
  - `src/lib/**` → `lib`
  - `src/hooks/**` → `hooks`
  - `src/app/globals.css`, `tailwind.config.js`, `src/App.css` → `styles`

- Infrastructure
  - `next.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json` → `config`
  - `package.json` (dependency only changes) → `deps`
  - Build and deployment files → `build`
  - Root files, `.cursor/**`, general repo changes → `repo`

### Multi-area changes
- If changes span multiple content areas (blog + talks) → `content`
- If changes span multiple UI areas → `ui`
- If changes are broadly cross-cutting (≥3 unrelated areas) → `repo`

## Inputs to use when generating
- The full diff and edit history from this session
- Changed files and their paths to infer scope using the rules above
- Commit messages, branch name, or linked issues if available

If context is insufficient to infer details, choose the best effort scope from filenames and touched areas. Do not ask questions; still produce both blocks.

## Output blocks (exactly two, nothing else)

```text
<prefix>(<scope>): <concise, imperative title>
```

```markdown
## Summary
<1–3 sentences>

## Context
<why this change was needed>

## Changes
- <key change 1>
- <key change 2>
- <key change 3>

## Implementation notes
- <notable decision or trade-off>

## Visual changes
- <UI/UX updates or screenshots>

## Breaking changes
- <explicitly list or state "None">

## Test plan
- <how verified>

## Performance impact
- <bundle size, load time, or state "No significant impact">

## Checklist
- [ ] Responsive design tested on mobile/desktop
- [ ] Accessibility checked (if UI changes)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Content renders correctly

<!-- Optionally: Closes #123 -->
