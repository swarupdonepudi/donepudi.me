# Rule: Create donepudi.me Changelog (action)

Purpose: When invoked, create a comprehensive changelog document in the `_changelog/` directory that captures the essence, context, and impact of recent work on the donepudi.me portfolio website. The changelog should be meaningful, well-structured, and appropriately sized based on the scope and impact of the change.

Usage: Invoke explicitly as `@create-donepudi-me-changelog` after completing meaningful work in a conversation.

References: `@understand-cursor-rules`, existing changelogs in `_changelog/`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Explicit Invocation Only

**DO NOT** create a changelog automatically or proactively. Changelogs must ONLY be created when the user explicitly invokes this rule with `@create-donepudi-me-changelog`.

Never:
- ❌ Suggest creating a changelog without being asked
- ❌ Create a changelog at the end of a conversation automatically
- ❌ Assume the user wants a changelog created
- ❌ Create a changelog "to be helpful" without explicit request

Always:
- ✅ Wait for explicit `@create-donepudi-me-changelog` invocation
- ✅ Confirm the request before creating the file
- ✅ Let the user decide when/if a changelog is needed

**This is a user-controlled action, not an automatic process.**

## When to Create a Changelog

Create a changelog when:
- ✅ You've added new content (blog posts, talks, portfolio sections)
- ✅ You've implemented new features or UI components
- ✅ You've made significant design or UX improvements
- ✅ You've refactored code with architectural changes
- ✅ You've integrated new APIs or third-party services
- ✅ The work involved multiple files or areas of the site
- ✅ You want to document the thinking behind design decisions
- ✅ Performance optimizations or SEO improvements
- ✅ New talk presentations or blog content systems

**Skip changelogs for**:
- ✋ Minor typo fixes
- ✋ Small CSS tweaks
- ✋ Dependency updates without functional changes
- ✋ Work-in-progress or incomplete features
- ✋ Changes already well-documented elsewhere

## Sizing Guidance: Use Your Judgment

**Critical principle**: The changelog length should be **proportional to the feature's complexity and impact**, not artificially constrained or inflated.

### Small Changes (150-300 lines)
- New blog post or talk content
- UI component styling updates
- Minor feature additions
- Bug fixes with context
- Content restructuring

**Example**: Add new blog post about cloud-native patterns - straightforward content addition

### Medium Changes (300-600 lines)
- New sections in portfolio
- Blog system enhancements
- UI component library additions
- Multiple content updates
- Talk presentation system features
- API integrations

**Example**: Build talk presentation system with slides, navigation, and progress bar

### Large Changes (600-1000+ lines)
- Major site redesign
- Complete section overhauls
- New interactive features
- Architecture migrations
- Multi-page feature implementations

**Example**: Redesign portfolio with new sections, animations, and responsive layouts

**Golden rule**: If you're unsure, start shorter and add detail only where it adds real value. Quality over quantity.

## Changelog Structure

### File Naming
```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-brief-descriptive-slug.md
```

Examples:
- `2025-11-23-085950-add-hyderabad-cncf-meetup-talk-presentation.md`
- `2025-11-20-143022-redesign-portfolio-hero-section.md`
- `2025-11-18-091200-integrate-base44-api-client.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Get the actual current timestamp by running the command `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` and use that exact output as the prefix for the filename. Do NOT make up or guess the timestamp.

### Required Metadata

Every changelog should start with metadata in this format:

```markdown
# [Clear, Descriptive Title]

**Date**: [Month Day, Year]
**Type**: [Enhancement | Bug Fix | Feature | Content | Design | Refactoring]
**Areas**: [Area1, Area2, Area3]

```

**Common Areas**:
- Blog
- Talks
- Portfolio
- UI Components
- Navigation/Layout
- API Integration
- Performance
- SEO
- Accessibility
- Design System
- Build/Deploy
- Content Management

---

**Status**: ✅ [Live | In Progress | Experimental]
```

### Optional Sections (Include When Valuable)

Add these sections only when they provide meaningful value:

- **Before/After**: Visual or functional comparisons
- **Performance Metrics**: Load times, bundle sizes, etc.
- **Browser Compatibility**: When relevant
- **Accessibility**: A11y improvements
- **SEO Impact**: Search optimization changes
- **Mobile Experience**: Responsive design notes
- **Design Decisions**: Why this approach vs alternatives
- **Content Strategy**: For content-focused changes
- **Technical Debt**: What was cleaned up
- **Known Issues**: Current limitations
- **Future Enhancements**: Planned follow-up work
- **Usage Examples**: How to use new features

## Writing Guidelines

### Do:
- ✅ **Start with context**: Why did this work happen?
- ✅ **Focus on value**: What does this improve for visitors/readers?
- ✅ **Use concrete examples**: Show actual content, components, or features
- ✅ **Include visuals**: Screenshots or descriptions of UI changes
- ✅ **Explain decisions**: Why this design/approach vs alternatives?
- ✅ **Write for future you**: Capture the thinking, not just the what
- ✅ **Link to related work**: Connect the dots with other changes
- ✅ **Use formatting**: Code blocks, lists, headers for readability
- ✅ **Show impact**: Metrics, user feedback, or observed improvements

### Don't:
- ❌ **Over-explain the obvious**: Assume the reader is technical
- ❌ **Include every detail**: Focus on what matters
- ❌ **Write generic summaries**: Be specific to this portfolio site
- ❌ **Skip the "why"**: Context is critical for future understanding
- ❌ **Ignore trade-offs**: Document decisions and their rationale
- ❌ **Use jargon without context**: Define terms that may be unclear

## Tone and Style

- **Personal but professional**: This is your portfolio, let personality show
- **Technical but accessible**: Balance depth with clarity
- **Honest about challenges**: "This was tricky because..." is fine
- **Present tense for descriptions**: "The site now includes..."
- **Past tense for actions**: "I redesigned the hero section"

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a changelog:

- [ ] Title clearly describes the change
- [ ] Metadata includes Date, Type, and Areas
- [ ] Summary captures essence in 2-4 sentences
- [ ] Motivation explains why work was needed
- [ ] What Changed describes the additions/modifications
- [ ] Implementation details are technical but focused
- [ ] Benefits are concrete and measurable
- [ ] Visual/UX impact is described (with screenshots if helpful)
- [ ] Code examples (if any) are actual code, not pseudocode
- [ ] Related work connects this to other changes
- [ ] Length is proportional to scope and impact
- [ ] No sensitive information (API keys, private data, etc.)

## Proportionality Examples

### ✅ Good: Appropriately Sized

**Small change** (200 lines):
- Motivation: 1 paragraph
- What Changed: 1-2 paragraphs + key components
- Benefits: 3-5 bullets
- Impact: 1 paragraph

**Medium change** (500 lines):
- Motivation: 2-3 paragraphs with goals
- What Changed: Component descriptions with examples
- Implementation: 3-4 key changes with code snippets
- Benefits: Categorized list with specifics
- Visual/UX Impact: Screenshots or detailed descriptions

**Large change** (900 lines):
- Motivation: Comprehensive context with background
- What Changed: Full feature breakdown with examples
- Implementation: Detailed technical sections per area
- Benefits: Quantitative and qualitative analysis
- Before/After: Visual comparisons
- Impact: Multi-dimensional (visitors, SEO, performance)

### ❌ Anti-patterns

- **Over-detailed small change**: 800-line changelog for a blog post
- **Under-documented major change**: 150-line changelog for major redesign
- **Too abstract**: Generic descriptions without specifics
- **Missing visuals**: UI changes without screenshots or descriptions

## donepudi.me Specific Guidelines

## Automation Notes

When creating the changelog:
1. **Get current timestamp**: Run `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` to get the actual current date and time for the filename
2. **Analyze the conversation**: Extract key decisions, changes, outcomes
3. **Assess scope**: Count files, areas affected
4. **Determine areas**: Map changes to area categories
5. **Choose type**: Enhancement, Feature, Content, Design, Bug Fix, Refactoring
6. **Size appropriately**: Match detail level to impact
7. **Write the file**: Create in `_changelog/` with proper naming using the timestamp from step 1
8. **Confirm creation**: Provide file path and next steps

## Example Invocations

```
"I've finished adding the CNCF talk presentation. @create-donepudi-me-changelog"

"The portfolio redesign is complete. @create-donepudi-me-changelog - this was a major visual overhaul"

"New blog system is working. @create-donepudi-me-changelog - include the markdown rendering improvements"
```

## Remember

**Changelogs are living documentation** that helps future you understand:
- What changed on the website
- Why it changed
- How it was implemented
- What the impact was on visitors/readers

Write for the person who will come back to this site in six months. Give them the context they need - no more, no less.

**When in doubt**: Start with the required sections, keep it focused, and add detail only where it truly helps understanding. A clear, concise 300-line changelog is better than a rambling 1000-line document.
