// @ts-check
// The threads' data: every call the threads page makes, to the threads' own calls under /threads/api/
// (src/threads.ts), behind Cloudflare Access. A list reads one list, 50 threads at a time, newest number first; a
// thread's call answers it with its comments, its history and its people; a move, a comment, a text and a new
// thread each answer what they changed; a search answers up to 20 threads for ⌘K. `me` says who is calling: the
// owner, or a person he invited, whose list is the threads they are in (`listMine`). The owner's people calls read,
// invite and remove the people on a thread. Every call refuses to follow a redirect: when the sign-in has run out,
// Access answers with a redirect to its sign-in page on another origin, which a followed fetch would report as a
// network error. A redirect, a 401 or a 403 with no reason of the Worker's is SignedOut; a 403 `caller` is
// NotShared (signed in, but no thread is shared with this address now); a 404 is Missing (a thread that isn't
// there, or one this browser may not read, which the page shows alike); anything else that fails is Failed, with
// the Worker's reason when it gave one. The page's writes carry JSON, which a form on another site can't send.
//
// A thread Swarup made public is also read with no sign-in, from the public call outside Access (`showPublic`,
// /api/threads/<n>, src/public.ts): what the thread says and the comments written as Public that are shown, in the
// private answer's own field names, so one renderer draws both. Its page loads from the public address too. A visitor
// who answers the page's questions sends their browser's key with the read (`X-Visitor-Key`), so the call says which
// answers are theirs and opens other people's under a question they answered. His ruling on a visitor's note or answer
// (`judge`: drop it, or show it again) is a private call of his own.
//
// Everyone he deals with is a person with a number (src/people.ts): `listPeople` reads everyone, `showPerson` one
// person with their threads and what they said, and `editPerson` changes their name, their address once, or his notes
// on them; an address another person holds is refused as Failed `email-taken`, whose `detail` names that person's
// number. A search answers the people whose name or address holds the words beside the threads, for him alone.
//
// Any thread can be one meeting (`meeting` on every thread: its when, length, where and people): `meet` sets or
// clears it, and `attendee` adds someone by number, or someone new by name, or takes one off; each answers the thread.
//
// One of his own threads whose main section is a page can be an ask, a questions page anyone answers by one link,
// /ask/<slug>, each browser that answers getting a thread of its own (`ask` on every thread says which it is).
// `listAsks` reads every ask for Asks, `askAction` opens, closes or marks an ask's answers read. A visitor reads an ask
// with no sign-in from its public call outside Access (`showAsk`, /api/asks/<slug>, src/asks.ts), sending their
// browser's key so it answers their own answers and nobody else's, and its page loads from that address too. Both
// public reads go through one fetch (`readPublic`).
//
// His journal (src/journal.ts) is read and written under /threads/api/journal: `listJournal` reads every entry's
// newest version, `readJournal` one entry's text with its versions and a day's typed answers, `journalStorylines`
// every storyline's trail. `saveJournal` saves his hand edit on the version it was opened at; a save the sync has
// since overtaken is refused as Failed `stale`, whose `detail` names the newest version, and nothing is written.
// `answerJournal` keeps a typed answer to a day's question. A photo loads from its own address (`journalPhoto`).
//
// His home page shows the threads he posts there (`feedAt` on every thread, set by the `post` move and cleared by
// `unpost` or `unpublish`) under his Now line, one line he sets from Today: `readNow` and `saveNow` (/threads/api/now,
// src/home.ts), his alone; an empty line takes it off the home page.
