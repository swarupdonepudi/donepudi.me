// @ts-check
// hey.donepudi.me: Swarup's threads, one page for all of them (site/threads/index.html, which the Worker hands
// over on the threads' host at every room's address and every thread's). Its root, /, is the door everyone signed in
// enters by, and the side rail is drawn for rooms, side by side at the top level: its head is the site, which leads
// to the home page's host (site/hosts.js), then Today (/), Threads
// (/threads/) with the five spaces under it, People (/people), Meetings (/meetings), Asks (/asks) and Journal
// (/journal). On a phone the bar holds Today, Threads, Find, New and More, with People, Meetings, Asks and Journal
// under More. His journal is his alone: the list of days week by week (/journal), a day or a week's chapter
// (/journal/2026-11-06, /journal/2026-W44) drawn from the page text the sync writes, read by site/app/journal.js,
// with Edit for the whole text, saved on the version it was opened at (a save the sync overtook keeps his words in
// the box and says so); the storylines' trail (/journal/storylines) and one storyline (/journal/storylines/the-demo);
// and on Today the latest day's card, its countdowns from today in his own zone, and its question with a box to
// answer it, kept with Undo. The views, each at its own address: Today
// (/: the next meeting as a card, then threads waiting on him, new ones, and open threads
// that sat a week untouched), the Threads room (/threads/, or /threads/?only=act&space=company: two tabs, Pending
// and Done, by where a thread stands (site/app/standing.js), Pending with a line of counts that shows one open status
// at a time and a tag on every row, and the five spaces), and a thread
// (/threads/42-who-owns-what): its living
// summary on top, then its main section, then its comments and its history in the order they happened. The main
// section is the thread's text, a page or a link: a page is a Claude artifact's own HTML, shown in a sealed frame
// at its own address (the Worker's src/page.ts sets the seal) with a bar for its versions, Open in Claude and full
// screen; a link is a card that opens an artifact on claude.ai. Everything comes from the threads' private calls
// (threads-store.js); the page holds no data of its own.
//
// It carries the inbox's ways of working: one key or tap sorts a thread (keys.js), no move asks "are you sure"
// (each shows a toast with Undo, which sends the move that reverses it), a move shows at once and is saved behind
// it, and one the server refuses is put back with a line that says so. Reply drafts an email in the thread and
// opens it in Gmail as the address he signed in with, for him to send. On top of that: comments (M), editing the
// title, summary and main text with a preview (W; a visitor's own words are never editable), new threads (N), and
// ⌘K, a search over numbers, titles, summaries and text. On a list the next thread is selected after a move that
// changes where it stands, whether or not it stays listed; on a thread the page stays, so its history shows the move.
//
// A thread can be shared. The owner's Share (S) invites a person by address and name, lists who is in the thread
// and takes an invitation back; his Gmail opens a draft with the thread's `?invite` link for him to send (share.js
// holds the sheet's words and the draft). He can write a comment for himself alone ("Only me", drawn dashed), and
// Today gains "Waiting on you": shared threads where an invited person had the last word. A person he invited
// gets the same page, knowing its caller (`me`): their threads (their home), each thread with its summary, its
// main section, its comments and its history as the Worker shapes them for them, and a comment box; no moves,
// edits, spaces, Reply or Share, and only their own keys. Removed from every thread, they are told "Nothing is
// shared with you now" rather than sent round the sign-in again.
//
// One of his own threads can be public (Share's switch). Anyone who isn't in it (signed out, signed in to other
// threads, or removed from every one) then reads it at its address in the public view: the thread as the public call
// answers it (`showPublic`, outside Access), the comments written as Public, and "Send Swarup a note on this", a form
// with the site's bot check (../talk-send.js) whose note shows at once. When its page asks questions, a visitor
// answers them too, with no sign-in: they type their name once (in a line above the page, or in the page's bar in full
// screen), and their browser keeps a random key with it (`localStorage`, or for the visit when storage is off), which
// the public call reads to say which answers are theirs; under each question the page shows their answer, and other
// people's once they gave their own. A thread's address with `?full` opens its page in full screen at once, which is
// the link Share offers for answering. On his side a visitor's note is a comment with Drop and Reply by email, a
// visitor's answer sits under its question and has a line in the history with Drop, and Drop's Undo shows it again;
// a visitor's word makes the thread wait on him, and a globe marks a public thread in every list. A comment on a
// public thread is written for anyone by default (Public), or for the people here, or for him alone. A visitor's words
// are drawn as typed, never as Markdown, wherever they show.
//
// A page that asks questions takes their answers in place, and any page takes comments on its words. The page's frame
// carries the bridge (frame/bridge.js), which speaks to this page by message alone (page-talk.js holds this side's
// checks): it draws an answer box under each of the page's questions, offers Comment beside selected words, and
// underlines the words each discussion is on (on a public thread, the answer boxes alone). Every write is this page's,
// as whoever is signed in or the visitor who named themselves: an answer the page asks for is taken only while the
// frame holds the focus (the reader clicked or typed in it), at most ten a minute,
// for a question the page named; words and replies are typed here, never in the frame. A discussion on the page's
// words sits beside them on a wide screen, in a column under the details; below 1000 px and in full screen its words
// open it in a sheet, and the page's discussions are listed under it. Every comment can have replies, except a
// visitor's note, a comment for anyone, an answer or a reply; the history keeps one line for each answer and
// discussion, with Show, and a discussion whose words this version no longer has stays in the history whole.
//
// Everyone he deals with is a person (people.js holds their words and addresses): People lists everyone at /people,
// whoever was last in touch first, those only ever in threads he dropped folded away; a person's page
// (/people/7-meera) shows the meetings they are in, every thread they are in and how, what they said, newest first,
// his own notes on them (only he reads them; Markdown, saved on ⌘↵ or on leaving the box), their name to change (W)
// and, while they have none, their address to add once. Every name on a thread opens that person for him (who a
// thread is from, a comment's author, a thread's people), and ⌘K finds people too. Invited people get none of this:
// at a people address they get their own home, as the Worker refuses them every people call.
//
// Any thread can be one meeting (meetings.js holds their words): a day, its time not set, or a moment shown in the
// reader's own zone, with a length, a where and the people in the room besides him. A meeting's thread opens with
// it as a strip above the summary, and his B (or the strip's button) opens its editor: the day and a time typed in
// his own zone, the length and the where, and the people, picked from everyone he deals with or added by name as
// someone new; clearing it takes its people off, with Undo. A row carries a meeting's date as a chip, solid while it
// is near. The Meetings room lists them, coming soonest first, then past. Being in one grants nothing: an invited
// person reads the meeting of a thread they are in, read only, with their own place marked, and gets Your meetings,
// the ones they are in, and their next one as a card at /, Today.
//
// An ask is one of his own threads whose page asks a few questions, handed to many people by one link, /ask/<slug>
// (asks.js holds their words). Asks lists them for him: drafts first, which only he opens, then every link with Copy
// link and Close (Open again once closed), how many answered and when. An ask's own thread carries a strip with its
// state and link, and Answered by above its page: each person a link to their own thread, new answers first, eight
// until Show all, which lists everyone in a box of its own with a filter by name, and Mark read for the new ones. Each
// person who answers is a thread of their own, a note from the site whose byline says they answered the ask, showing the
// ask's page with their answers under its questions and no box for him to type in (the bridge's `read` hello); new
// answers wait on him, and Today folds several new answers to one ask into one row that opens the ask. The ask's
// address draws its page for anyone, signed in or not, with no call to who is calling: full screen, under a bar with
// a name and an email, both optional, until the first answer, its boxes saying only Swarup reads them (the bridge's
// `private` hello); a closed ask shows its questions with no boxes and a way to send a note instead, and a draft or an
// address no ask has shows "Nothing here".
//
// Signed out at a thread's address, the page shows what a missing address shows ("Nothing here"), so the address
// alone never says a thread exists; a device that has signed in before also gets a small "Sign in". The link in an
// invitation carries `?invite`: signed out, it goes straight to the sign-in and back; signed in, the page drops it
// from the address, so a copied link is the clean one. `?invite` on any number does the same, so it says nothing
// about a thread. At /, /meetings and a people address (which says nothing about whether a person exists) it says
// "Swarup's private space" with a Sign in button, and at /threads/ itself "Threads" with one. An invited person's home is
// Today too: the rail lists their threads under "Shared with you, by Swarup". Either sign-in goes through the
// threads' sign-in call and comes back to the same address. When the sign-in ends mid-use, a line says so and nothing typed
// is lost. Every element is built with DOM calls and every text is set as text, so nothing anyone wrote becomes
// markup; Markdown is parsed into blocks first (markdown.js). The CSP allows no inline script or style attribute.
