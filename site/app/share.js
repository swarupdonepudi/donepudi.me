// @ts-check
// Sharing a thread, as the owner's Share sheet says it (site/app/threads.js draws the sheet): the check an invitation
// passes before it is sent, the lines that tell him what an invited person will see and how many people have access,
// and the invitation itself, a draft his own Gmail opens for him to send; nothing is sent from the site. The link in
// it is the thread's own address with `?invite`, which takes a signed-out reader straight to Cloudflare's code page
// and back. Below the people, one switch makes the thread public: anyone reads it at its address with no sign-in,
// and only his own threads may be (`publicLines` says what the switch says, and why it is off for someone else's
// words). Under it, a second switch lists a public thread on his home page, under What's happening and in its feed
// (`feedLines`): public alone is readable by its link, never listed, so listing is its own act, and only a public thread
// can be listed. A visitor's note on a public thread is answered from his own Gmail too (`noteReply`). Plain data and
// pure functions, so a test can read them without a page.
