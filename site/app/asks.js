// that answers it becomes a thread of its own (the Worker's src/asks.ts). These are the words and addresses the pages
// use: the Asks room's rows (the link, how many answered, the state, the Send a note topic that opens it), the folded
// row Today shows for several new answers to one ask, the head of an ask's Answered by and the filter over it, a
// response thread's byline, the history's lines for an ask, and what a visitor on /ask/<slug> reads around the page.
// Plain data and pure functions, so a test can read them without a page (test/asks-words.test.ts).
