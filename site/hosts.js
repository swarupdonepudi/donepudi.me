// threads with Today at their root, one label below it, at `hey.` (hey.donepudi.me). The rule is derived from the
// host a request came to, never configured, so production, the local look (localhost:8790 and hey.localhost:8790) and
// the tests all follow it with nothing to set. A link from one host to the other is built here, never typed. Plain
// data and pure functions, with no page and no side effect, so a test reads them without a page and the Worker
// type-checks them with no browser library.
