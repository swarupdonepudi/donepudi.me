// What a thread can be about: every topic a visitor's note can name (site/talk-topics.js), plus the spaces only
// Swarup and the sync file threads under, such as the company. The Worker checks a thread's space against this
// list, and the threads' pages will draw it. Topics carry the questions a visitor sees; a space is only a name,
// so the two lists stay apart, and the site test holds that every topic is a space. Plain data and pure
// functions with no page and no side effect, because the Worker imports this file too.
