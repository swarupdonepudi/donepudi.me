// The privacy probe the deploy runs against the live site after every deploy (`.github/workflows/site.yaml`, job
// `private`), holding no key: it asks for Swarup's private calls on the threads' host (hey.donepudi.me, derived
// from the home page's origin by site/hosts.js) as a stranger would, with no sign-in and with a forged one, and fails
// unless each stops at Cloudflare Access's sign-in, never answering a word. His journal's calls are all asked, every
// kind of address under /threads/api/journal (the list, a day, an earlier version, a week, the storylines, a photo),
// and the threads' own private calls beside them (a tab's list, the people, the asks, a thread, the home page's Now
// line). The journal's pages are asked too: each must be the same shell as the threads' root, Today, byte for byte,
// because a page holds no words and reads them only from the calls after sign-in. A recent day's address is asked
// whatever the date, since the shell is the same for a day written or not. The home page's host is asked for the
// threads' old addresses there, each of which must be gone (404), so the old door stays shut. This module is the
// logic, with fetch handed in so a test plays the site; tools/probe/run.ts is the entry point.
