// The inbox's command-line client: how the recorder sync, and any session on Swarup's Mac, lists, adds, moves,
// comments on, rewrites and reads the threads in Swarup's private inbox through the threads' calls
// (src/threads.ts), naming each thread by its number, and reads the people he deals with (src/people.ts) by
// theirs, without changing any, as the sync's Cloudflare Access service token. Its client
// id is wrangler.jsonc's public var; its secret comes only from the environment (`INBOX_SYNC_CLIENT_SECRET`), is
// sent only in the Access header, and is never printed or written anywhere. Every answer is one JSON line on
// stdout; a refusal exits non-zero with the Worker's reason. Words (a comment, a summary, a main text) come on
// stdin, so quotes and line breaks need no escaping. A page (a Claude artifact's own HTML) comes from a file,
// because pages are large, and is refused here past the Worker's 16 MiB before it is sent; a link is an address on
// claude.ai. A meeting is set on a thread by its when (a day, or a moment always with its zone), and its people are
// added by their person number, or by name as someone new. An ask (a questions page anyone answers by one link) is
// made a draft from a thread whose page holds its questions, and closed; it has no verb that opens one, because
// putting it before strangers is Swarup's own act, from his page. His journal (src/journal.ts) is read and written
// under `journal`: an entry's page text comes on stdin and is saved on the version it was built on, so a save built on
// an older text is refused as stale and the sync reads, rebuilds and writes again; a photo goes up from a file and comes
// back to one, byte for byte. This module is the logic, with fetch, the environment and
// the streams handed in, so the tests drive it with a played fetch; tools/inbox/inbox.ts is the entry point
// that hands it the real ones.
